## About Guitar Notes
I like to play guitar, but I’m not a good guitar player. I also like to design and write code, but I’m not good at those either, so I built this thing.

I would love help with all of it: I have started to set up an environment here for some templating using the dependencies below, but I could use help making it work.

## Built With
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Embedded JavaScript Templating](https://ejs.co/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax)
