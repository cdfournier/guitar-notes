# Guitar Notes
I like to play guitar, but I’m not a good guitar player. I also like to design and write code, but I’m not good at those either, so I built this thing.

## About Guitar Notes
I like to play guitar, but I'm not a good guitar player. So over the years I've developed my own style to compensate. I also try to transcribe songs to my style. Sometimes that means changing the chords or the strumming patterns. Sometimes I even adapt the lyrics. I used to know only a handful of songs that were easy enough to remember, but I continue to add more songs so it's become necessary to create a means for me to pull up my notes any time or place.

I also like to design in code. I love the power of designing in code: there is so much you can do with a little `html`, `css`, a little `jQuery`, and some `git`. Like my guitar playing and singing, neither my coding nor my design skills are very advanced.

I would love help with all of it: I have started to set up an environment here for some templating using the dependencies below, but I could use help making it work.
