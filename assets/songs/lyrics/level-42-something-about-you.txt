How how can it be that a love
Carved out of caring fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games played much too often

But making mistakes is a part
Of life's imperfections
Born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all

Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth

That there is something about you
Baby so right
I wouldn't be without you
Baby tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life

Gone fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love it's not so wrong
We're only human after all

Oh these changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh and you need to hear the time
That told the truth

Because there's something about you
Baby so right
I couldn't live without you
Baby tonight

Because there's something about you
Baby so right
I couldn't live without you
Baby tonight
