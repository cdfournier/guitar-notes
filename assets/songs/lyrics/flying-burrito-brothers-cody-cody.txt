Cody Cody I hear you say
I hear your voice calling me away
I'm not afraid to think of what I might find
I will be yours will you be mine

We've all been young we've all been old
We've all been sheltered from the cold
Come by my side and say what I think I already know
I'm going away don't you want to go

I remember the face that Harvey drew
It was of a man that my eyes saw through
Come by my side before the evening is gone
And see where else this body's flown
Where it flown
