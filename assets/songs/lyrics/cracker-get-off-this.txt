All these cats with holey jeans
Dirty hair and titty rings
Say what's your scene man We got these questions
Is it true that you have sold your soul
I say hey man I don't know
Lend me a quarter won't you I'll call my accountant

Let's get off this
And get on with it
If you wanna change the world
Shut your mouth and start to spin it

Get off this
Get on with it
If you wanna change the world
Shut your mouth and start this minute

Petty little Ayatollahs
Come around to judge and stone ya

Yeah we ain't got no government loans
And no one sends a check from home
But get this we're just doin' what we wanna

So let's get off this
And get on with it
If you wanna change the world
Shut your mouth and start to spin it

Get off this
Get on with it
If you wanna change the world
Shut your mouth and start this minute

Well the guitar player's stayin'
Out in Hollywood and sayin'
He's just tryin' to get some sleep but everyone's complainin'
Are you truly deeply cynical
'Cause boy you know that I loved you so
When no one knew your name and you were pompous

Let's get off this
And get on with it
If you wanna change the world
Shut your mouth and start to spin it

Get on with it
If you wanna change the world
Shut your mouth shut your mouth
