Well I've been up to Paris
And I've slept in a park
Went down to Barcelona
Someone broke in my car

And I'll search the world over
For my angel in black
Yeah I'll search the world over
For a Euro-trash girl

Took the train down to Athens
And I slept in a fountain
Some Swiss junkie in Turin
Ripped me off for my cash

Yeah I'll search the world over
For my angel in black
Yeah I'll search the world over
For a Euro-trash girl

The CRS on the Metro
Shook me down for a bribe
On my knees for the sergeant
When my passport arrived

Yeah I'll search the world over
For my angel in black
Yeah I'll search the world over
For a Euro-trash girl

Euro-trash girl
Euro-trash girl
Euro-trash girl
Euro-trash girl

Called my mom from a payphone
I said I'm down to my last
She said I sent you to college
Now go call your dad

And the waitress that he married
Well she hung up the phone
Ya know she never did like me
But I can stand on my own

Sold my plasma in Amsterdam
Spent it all in a night
Buying drinks at the Melkweg
For a soldier in drag

And I'll search the world over
For my angel in black
Yeah I'll search the world over
For a Euro-trash girl

Euro-trash girl
Euro-trash girl
Euro-trash girl
My Euro-trash girl

Yeah I'll search the world over
For my angel in black
Yeah I'll search the world over
For a Euro-trash girl

Solo Johnny!

Got a tattoo in Berlin
And a case of the crabs
A rose and a dagger
On the palm of my hand

And I'll search the world over
For my angel in black
Yeah I'll search the world over
For a Euro-trash girl

Euro-trash girl
Euro-trash girl
Euro-trash girl
(Yeah) Euro-trash girl
Yeah I'll search the world over
For my angel in black
Yeah I'll search the world over
For a Euro-trash girl
