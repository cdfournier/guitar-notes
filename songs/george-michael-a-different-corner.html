          <p>But to lose you would <span class="chords">D</span>cut like a knife</p>
          <p>So I <span class="chords">Am</span>don't dare no I <span class="chords">G</span>don't dare</p>
          <p>'Cause I've <span class="chords">G</span>never come close in <span class="chords">D</span>all of these <span class="chords">G</span>years</p>
