          <p>In our endeavor we are never seeing eye to eye</p>
          <p>No guts to serve us so forever may we wave goodbye</p>
          <p>And you're always telling me that it's my turn to move</p>
          <p>When I wonder what could make the needle jump the groove</p>

          <p>I won't fall for the oldest trick in the book</p>
          <p>So don't sit there and think you're off of the hook</p>
          <p>By saying there is no use changing 'cause</p>

          <p>Acting steady always ready to defend your fears</p>
          <p>What's the matter with the truth, did I offend your ears</p>
          <p>By suggesting that a change might be a thing to try</p>
          <p>Like it would kill you just to try and be a nicer guy</p>

          <p>It's not like you would lose some critical piece</p>

          <p>Now I could talk to you till I'm blue in the face</p>
          <p>But we still would arrive at the very same place</p>
