        <h2>That's Just What You Are</h2><p>by Aimee Mann from <b>I'm With Stupid</b></p>
        <div class="details">
          <p>Capo on 3rd fret</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details simple">
          <p><span class="chords">G</span> <span class="chords">Em</span> <span class="chords">Bm</span> <span class="chords">D</span></p>
          <p>In our endeavor we are never seeing eye to eye</p>
          <p>No guts to serve us so forever may we wave goodbye</p>
          <p>And you're always telling me that it's my turn to move</p>
          <p>When I wonder what could make the needle jump the groove</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details simple">
          <p><span class="chords">C</span> <span class="chords">G</span> <span class="chords">Am</span> <span class="chords">Em</span></p>
          <p>I won't fall for the oldest trick in the book</p>
          <p>So don't sit there and think you're off of the hook</p>
          <p>By saying there is no use changing 'cause</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details simple">
          <p><span class="chords">C</span> <span class="chords">D</span> <span class="chords">G</span> <span class="chords">F</span></p>
          <p>That's just what you are</p>
          <p>That's just what you are</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details simple">
          <p><span class="chords">G</span> <span class="chords">Em</span> <span class="chords">Bm</span> <span class="chords">D</span></p>
          <p>Acting steady always ready to defend your fears</p>
          <p>What's the matter with the truth, did I offend your ears</p>
          <p>By suggesting that a change might be a thing to try</p>
          <p>Like it would kill you just to try and be a nicer guy</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details simple">
          <p><span class="chords">C</span> <span class="chords">G</span> <span class="chords">Am</span> <span class="chords">Em</span></p>
          <p>It's not like you would lose some critical piece</p>
          <p>If somehow you moved point A to point B</p>
          <p>Maintaining there is no point changing 'cause</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details simple">
          <p><span class="chords">C</span> <span class="chords">D</span> <span class="chords">G</span> <span class="chords">F</span></p>
          <p>That's just what you are</p>
          <p>That's just what you are</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details simple">
          <p><span class="chords">Em</span> <span class="chords">G</span> <span class="chords">C</span> <span class="chords">D</span></p>
          <p>Now I could talk to you till I'm blue in the face</p>
          <p>But we still would arrive at the very same place</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p><span class="chords">G</span>With you running <span class="chords">Em</span>around and me <span class="chords">D</span>out of the <span class="chords">C</span>race <span class="chords">Am</span></p>
        </div>
        <div class="details simple">
          <p><span class="chords">C</span> <span class="chords">G</span> <span class="chords">Am</span> <span class="chords">Em</span></p>
          <p>So maybe you're right, nobody can take</p>
          <p>Something older than time and hope you could make</p>
          <p>It better, that would be a mistake</p>
          <p>So take it just so far</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details simple">
          <p><span class="chords">C</span> <span class="chords">D</span> <span class="chords">G</span> <span class="chords">F</span></p>
          <p>'Cause that's just what you are</p>
          <p>That's just what you are</p>
          <p>That's just what you are</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details simple">
          <p><span class="chords">G</span> <span class="chords">F</span> <span class="chords">C</span> <span class="chords">D</span></p>
          <p>Acting steady always ready to defend your fears</p>
          <p>What's the matter with the truth, did I offend your ears</p>
          <p>You're like a sleepwalking man, it's a danger to wake you</p>
          <p>Even when it is apparent where your actions will take you</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details simple">
          <p><span class="chords">G</span> <span class="chords">F</span> <span class="chords">C</span> <span class="chords">D</span>     </p>
          <p>That's just what you are</p>
          <p>And that's just what you are</p>
          <p>That's just what you are</p>
          <p>That's just what you are</p>
