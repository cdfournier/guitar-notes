          <p>Oh where oh where can my baby be</p>
          <p>The Lord took her away from me</p>
          <p>She's gone to heaven so I got to be good</p>
          <p>So I can see my baby when I leave this world</p>

        <div class="details simple">
          <p>We were out on a date in my daddy's car</p>
          <p>We hadn't driven very far</p>
          <p>There in the road straight ahead</p>
          <p>A car was stalled the engine was dead</p>
          <p>I couldn't stop so I swerved to the right</p>
          <p>I'll never forget the sound that night</p>
          <p>The screamin' tires the bustin' glass</p>
          <p>The painful scream that I heard last</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details simple">
          <p>Oh where oh where can my baby be</p>
          <p>The Lord took her away from me</p>
          <p>She's gone to heaven so I got to be good</p>
          <p>So I can see my baby when I leave this world</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details simple">
          <p>When I woke up the rain was pourin' down</p>
          <p>There were people standing all around</p>
          <p>Something warm flowin' through my eyes</p>
          <p>But somehow I found my baby that night</p>
          <p>I lifted her head she looked at me and said</p>
          <p>Hold me darling just a little while</p>
          <p>I held her close I kissed her our last kiss</p>
          <p>I found the love that I knew I had missed</p>
          <p>And now she's gone even though I hold her tight</p>
          <p>I lost my love my life that night</p>
