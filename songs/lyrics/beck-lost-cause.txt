Your sorry eyes they cut through bone
Make it hard to leave you alone
Leave you here wearing your wounds
Waving your guns at somebody new
Baby you're lost
Baby you're lost
Baby you're a lost cause
There's too many people you used to know
They see you coming they see you go
They know your secrets and you know theirs
This town is crazy but nobody cares
Baby you're lost
Baby you're lost
Baby you're a lost cause
I'm tired of fightin'
I'm tired of fightin'
Fighting for a lost cause
There's a place where you are goin'
You ain't never been before
There's no one laughing at your back now
No one standing at your door
Is that what you thought love was for
Baby you're lost
Baby you're lost
Baby you're a lost cause
I'm tired of fightin'
I'm tired of fightin'
Fighting for a lost cause
