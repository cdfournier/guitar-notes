Everyday I get up and pray to Jah
And he increases the number of clocks
By exactly one
Everybody's coming home for lunch these days
Last night there were skinheads on my lawn
Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling
Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling
Some people say bowling alleys 
got big lanes
Some people say that bowling alleys
all look the same
There's not a line that goes here
That rhymes with anything
Had a dream last night
But I forget what it was
Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling
Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling
Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling
Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling
Had a dream last night
About you my friend
Had a dream
I wanted to sleep next to plastic
Had a dream
I wanted to lick your knees
Had a dream
It was about nothing
Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling
Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling
Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling
Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling
