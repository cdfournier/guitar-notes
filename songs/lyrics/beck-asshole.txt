Your brains went black when she took back her love
And put it out into the sun
The birds did fly when the heavens all went dry
And the cigarettes were smoking by themselves
She'll do anything
She'll do anything
She'll do anything to make you feel like an asshole
Call her name, she looks the same as you
Question marks stretched across her skin
She dangles carrots, makes you feel embarrassed
To be the fool you know you are
She'll do anything
She'll do anything
She'll do anything to make you feel like an asshole
