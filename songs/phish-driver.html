        <h2>Driver</h2><p>by Phish from <b>Farmhouse</b></p>
        <div class="details">
          <p><span class="chords">G</span>I'll tell you about the driver that <span class="chords">C</span>lives inside my <span class="chords">G</span>head</p>
          <p><span class="chords">G</span>Starts me up and <span class="chords">C</span>stops me and <span class="chords">Em</span>puts me into <span class="chords">D</span>bed</p>
          <p><span class="chords">G</span>He opens up my mouth when its <span class="chords">C</span>time for me to <span class="chords">G</span>talk</p>
          <p><span class="chords">G</span>And fires up my <span class="chords">C</span>legs when he wants me to <span class="chords">G</span>walk</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p><span class="chords">C</span>Keeps my eyes <span class="chords">G</span>open <span class="chords">C</span>for most of the <span class="chords">G</span>day</p>
          <p><span class="chords">C</span>Adds to my <span class="chords">G</span>memory the <span class="chords">Em</span>things that people <span class="chords">D</span>say</p>
          <p><span class="chords">C</span>When he makes <span class="chords">G</span>decisions <span class="chords">C</span>I don't have to <span class="chords">Em</span>wait</p>
          <p><span class="chords">C</span>But sometimes it seems that he's got too much on his <span class="chords">G</span>plate</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p><span class="chords">G</span>Like this morning when I woke up <span class="chords">C</span>and he dressed me in this <span class="chords">G</span>shirt</p>
          <p><span class="chords">G</span>It looks a little <span class="chords">C</span>ragged where he <span class="chords">Em</span>dragged me through the <span class="chords">D</span>dirt</p>
          <p><span class="chords">G</span>I'm moving through this life <span class="chords">C</span>and I'm thinking about the <span class="chords">G</span>next</p>
          <p><span class="chords">G</span>I'm hoping when I <span class="chords">C</span>get there I'll be better <span class="chords">G</span>dressed</p>
