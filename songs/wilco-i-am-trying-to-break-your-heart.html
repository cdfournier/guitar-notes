          <p>I am an American aquarium drinker</p>
          <p>I assassin down the avenue</p>
          <p>I'm hiding out in the big city blinking</p>
          <p>What was I thinking when I let go of you</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p>Let's forget about the tongue-tied lightning</p>
          <p>Let's undress just like cross-eyed strangers</p>
          <p>This is not a joke so please stop smiling</p>
          <p>What was I thinking when I said it didn't hurt</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p>I want to glide through these brown eyes gleaming</p>
          <p>Deep from the inside, baby hold on tight</p>
          <p>You were so right when you said I'd been drinking</p>
          <p>What was I thinking when we said goodnight</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p>I want to hold you in the bible-black pre-dawn</p>
          <p>You're quite a quiet domino, bury me now</p>
          <p>Take off your band-aid 'cause I don't believe in touch-downs</p>
          <p>What was I thinking when we said hello</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p>I always thought that if I held you tightly</p>
          <p>You would always love me like you did back then</p>
          <p>Then I fell asleep and the city kept blinking</p>
          <p>What was i thinking when I let you back in</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p>I am trying to break your heart</p>
          <p>I am trying to break your heart</p>
          <p>And still I'd be lying if I said it wasn't easy</p>
          <p>I am trying to break your heart</p>
