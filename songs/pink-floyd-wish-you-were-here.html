          <p>Can you tell a green <span class="chords">D</span>field from a cold steel <span class="chords">C</span>rail? A smile from a <span class="chords">Am</span>veil?</p>

          <p>Do you think you can <span class="chords">G</span>tell? Did they get you to <span class="chords">D</span>trade your heroes for <span class="chords">D</span>ghosts?</p>

          <p>Running over the same old ground <span class="chords">C</span> what have we found the same old <span class="chords">Am</span>fears?</p>
