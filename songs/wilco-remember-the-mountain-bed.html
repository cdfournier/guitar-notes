        <div class="details">
          <p><span class="chords">D</span>Do you still sing of the <span class="chords">A</span>mountain bed we <span class="chords">G</span>made of limbs and leaves</p>
          <p><span class="chords">G</span>Do you still sigh there near the sky where the <span class="chords">D</span>holly berry <span class="chords">A</span>bleeds</p>
          <p><span class="chords">Bm</span>You laughed as I covered you <span class="chords">D</span>over with leaves</p>
          <p><span class="chords">C</span>Face, breasts, hips, and <span class="chords">G</span>thighs</p>
          <p><span class="chords">D</span>You smiled when I said the <span class="chords">A</span>leaves were just the <span class="chords">G</span>color of your <span class="chords">D</span>eyes</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p><span class="chords">D</span>Rosin smells and <span class="chords">A</span>turpentine smells from <span class="chords">G</span>eucalyptus and pine</p>
          <p><span class="chords">G</span>Bitter tastes of twigs we chewed where <span class="chords">D</span>tangled wood vines <span class="chords">A</span> twine</p>
          <p><span class="chords">Bm</span>Trees held us in on <span class="chords">D</span>all four sides so <span class="chords">C</span>thick we could not <span class="chords">G</span>see</p>
          <p><span class="chords">D</span>I could not see any <span class="chords">A</span>wrong in you and you <span class="chords">G</span>saw none in <span class="chords">D</span>me</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p><span class="chords">D</span>Your arm was brown <span class="chords">A</span>against the ground your <span class="chords">G</span>cheeks part of the sky</p>
          <p><span class="chords">G</span>As your fingers played with grassy moss and <span class="chords">D</span>limber did you <span class="chords">A</span>lie</p>
          <p><span class="chords">Bm</span>Your stomach moved <span class="chords">D</span>beneath your shirt and your <span class="chords">C</span>knees were in the <span class="chords">G</span>air</p>
          <p><span class="chords">D</span>Your feet played games with <span class="chords">A</span>mountain roots as you <span class="chords">G</span>lay thinking <span class="chords">D</span>there</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p><span class="chords">D</span>Below us the trees <span class="chords">A</span>grew clumps of trees <span class="chords">G</span>raised families of trees and they</p>
          <p><span class="chords">G</span>As proud as we tossed their heads in the <span class="chords">D</span>wind and flung good seeds <span class="chords">A</span>away</p>
          <p><span class="chords">Bm</span>The sun was hot and the <span class="chords">D</span>sun was bright <span class="chords">C</span>down in the valley <span class="chords">G</span>below</p>
          <p><span class="chords">D</span>Where people starved and <span class="chords">A</span>hungry for life so <span class="chords">G</span>empty come and <span class="chords">D</span>go</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p><span class="chords">D</span>There in the shade and <span class="chords">A</span>hid from the sun we <span class="chords">G</span>freed our minds and learned</p>
          <p><span class="chords">G</span>Our greatest reason for being here our <span class="chords">D</span>bodies moved and <span class="chords">A</span>burned</p>
          <p><span class="chords">Bm</span>There on our mountain <span class="chords">D</span>bed of leaves we <span class="chords">C</span>learned life's reason <span class="chords">G</span>why</p>
          <p><span class="chords">D</span>The people laugh and <span class="chords">A</span>love and dream, they <span class="chords">G</span>fight, they hate to <span class="chords">D</span>die</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p><span class="chords">D</span>The smell of your hair I <span class="chords">A</span>know is still there if <span class="chords">G</span>most of our leaves are blown</p>
          <p><span class="chords">Bm</span>Our words still ring in the brush and the <span class="chords">D</span>trees where singing seeds are <span class="chords">A</span>sown</p>
          <p><span class="chords">Bm</span>Your shape and form is <span class="chords">D</span>dim but plain <span class="chords">C</span>there on our mountain <span class="chords">G</span>bed</p>
          <p><span class="chords">D</span>I see my life was <span class="chords">A</span>brightest where you <span class="chords">G</span>laughed and laid your <span class="chords">D</span>head</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p><span class="chords">D</span>I learned the reason why <span class="chords">A</span>man must work and <span class="chords">G</span>how to dream big dreams</p>
          <p><span class="chords">G</span>To conquer time and space and fight the <span class="chords">D</span>rivers and the <span class="chords">A</span>seas</p>
          <p><span class="chords">Bm</span>I stand here filled with my <span class="chords">D</span>emptiness now and <span class="chords">C</span>look at city and <span class="chords">G</span>land</p>
          <p><span class="chords">D</span>And I know why farms and <span class="chords">A</span>cities are built by <span class="chords">G</span>hot, warm, nervous <span class="chords">D</span>hands</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p><span class="chords">D</span>I crossed many states just to <span class="chords">A</span>stand here now my <span class="chords">G</span>face all hot with tears</p>
          <p><span class="chords">G</span>I crossed city, and valley, desert, and <span class="chords">D</span>stream, to bring my body <span class="chords">A</span>here</p>
          <p><span class="chords">Bm</span>My history and future blaze <span class="chords">D</span>bright in me and <span class="chords">C</span>all my joy and <span class="chords">G</span>pain</p>
          <p><span class="chords">D</span>Go through my head on our <span class="chords">A</span>mountain bed where I <span class="chords">G</span>smell your hair <span class="chords">D</span>again</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p><span class="chords">D</span>All this day long I linger here and <span class="chords">A</span>on in through the <span class="chords">G</span>night</p>
          <p><span class="chords">G</span>My greeds, desires, my cravings, hopes, my <span class="chords">D</span>dreams inside me <span class="chords">A</span>fight</p>
          <p><span class="chords">Bm</span>My loneliness healed, my <span class="chords">D</span>emptiness filled, I <span class="chords">C</span>walk above all <span class="chords">G</span>pain</p>
          <p><span class="chords">D</span>Back to the breasts of my <span class="chords">A</span>woman and child to scatter my <span class="chords">G</span>seeds <span class="chords">D</span>again</p>
