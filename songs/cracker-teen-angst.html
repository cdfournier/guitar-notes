        <p>by Cracker from <b>Cracker</b></p>
        <section>
          <p><span>[D]</span>I don't know what the world may need</p>
          <p>But I'm <span>[G]</span>sure as hell that it starts with me</p>
          <p>And that's a <span>[C]</span>wisdom <span>[G]</span> I've <span>[D]</span>laughed at</p>
          <p>I don't know what the world may want</p>
          <p>But a <span>[G]</span>good stiff drink it surely don't</p>
          <p>So I <span>[C]</span>think I'll go and <span>[G]</span>fix myself a <span>[D]</span>tall one</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>'Cause what the world needs now</p>
          <p>Is a <span>[G]</span>new, kind, attention</p>
          <p>'Cause the <span>[C]</span>old one just <span>[G]</span>bores me to <span>[D]</span>death</p>
          <p>'Cause what the world needs now</p>
          <p>Is <span>[C]</span>another folk <span>[G]</span>singer</p>
          <p>Like <span>[C]</span>I need a <span>[G]</span>hole in my <span>[D]</span>head</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>I don't know what the world may need</p>
          <p>But a <span>[G]</span>V-8 engine's a good start for me</p>
          <p>Think I'll <span>[C]</span>drive and find a <span>[G]</span>place to be <span>[D]</span>surly</p>
          <p>I don't know what the world may want</p>
          <p>But some <span>[G]</span>words of wisdom could comfort us</p>
          <p>Think I'll <span>[C]</span>leave that up to <span>[G]</span> someone <span>[D]</span>wiser</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>'Cause what the world needs now</p>
          <p>Are some <span>[G]</span>true words of wisdom</p>
          <p>Like <span>[C]</span>la la la la la <span>[G]</span>la la la <span>[D]</span>la</p>
          <p>'Cause what the world needs now</p>
          <p>Is <span>[C]</span>another folk <span>[G]</span>singer</p>
          <p>Like <span>[C]</span>I need a <span>[G]</span>hole in my <span>[D]</span>head</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>I don't know what the world may need</p>
          <p>And I never <span>[G]</span>grasped your complexities</p>
          <p>I'd be <span>[C]</span>happy just to <span>[G]</span>get your <span>[D]</span>attention</p>
          <p>I don't know what the world may want</p>
          <p>But your <span>[G]</span>long sweet body lying next to mine</p>
          <p>Could <span>[C]</span>certainly <span>[G]</span> raise my <span>[D]</span>spirits</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>'Cause what the world needs now</p>
          <p>Is a <span>[G]</span>new Frank Sinatra</p>
          <p>So <span>[C]</span>I can <span>[G]</span>get you in <span>[D]</span>bed</p>
          <p>What the world needs now</p>
          <p>Is <span>[C]</span>another folk <span>[G]</span>singer</p>
