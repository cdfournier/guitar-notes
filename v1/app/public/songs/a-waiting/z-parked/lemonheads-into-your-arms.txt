I know a place where I can go when I'm alone
Into your arms whoa into your arms I can go
I know a place that's safe and warm from the crowd
Into your arms whoa into your arms I can go

And if I should fall
I know I won't be alone
Be alone anymore

I know a place where I can go when I'm alone
Into your arms whoa into your arms I can go
I know a place that's safe and warm from the crowd
Into your arms whoa into your arms I can go

So if I should fall
I know I won't be alone
Be alone anymore

I know a place where I can go when I'm alone
Into your arms whoa into your arms I can go
I can go
