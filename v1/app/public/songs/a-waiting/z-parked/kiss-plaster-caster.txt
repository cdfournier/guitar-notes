Baby's getting anxious
The hour's getting late
The night is almost over
She can't wait

The things are complicating
My love is in her hands
And there's no more waiting
She understands

The plaster's gettin' harder
And my love is perfection
A token of my love
For her collection her collection

Plaster caster
Grab a hold of me faster
If you wanna see my love
Just ask her

And my love is in plaster
And yes she's the collector
She wants me
All the time to inject her

The plaster's gettin' harder
And my love is perfection
A token of my love
For her collection

Plaster caster
Grab a hold of me faster
If you wanna see my love
Just ask her ask her
Ask her

The plaster's gettin' harder
And my love is perfection
A token of my love
For her collection her collection

Plaster caster
Grab a hold of me faster
If you wanna see my love
Just ask her ask her

Plaster caster
She wants my love to last her
And she calls me
By the name of master

Plaster caster
Grab a hold of me faster
If you wanna see my love
Just ask her ask her

Plaster caster
Grab a hold of me faster
If you wanna see my love
Just ask her ask her
