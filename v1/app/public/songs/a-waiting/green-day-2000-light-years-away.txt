I sit alone in my bedroom
Staring at the walls
I've been up all damn night long
My pulse is speeding my love is yearning

I hold my breath and close my eyes and
I dream about her
'Cause she's 2000 light years away

She holds my malachite so tight so
Never let go
'Cause she's 2000 light years away
Years away

I sit outside and watch the sunrise
Lookout as far as I can
I can't see her but in the distance
I hear some laughter we laugh together

I hold my breath and close my eyes and
I dream about her
'Cause she's 2000 light years away

She holds my malachite so tight so
Never let go
'Cause she's 2000 light years away
Years away

I sit alone in my bedroom
Staring at the walls
I've been up all damn night long
My pulse is speeding my love is yearning

I hold my breath and close my eyes and
I dream about her
'Cause she's 2000 light years away

She holds my malachite so tight so
Never let go
'Cause she's 2000 light years away
Years away
