I don't feel the sun's comin' out today
It's stayin' in it's gonna find another way yeah
As I sit here in this misery
I don't think I'll ever know Lord
See the sun from here

And oh as I fade away
They'll all look at me and say
And they'll say Hey look at him
I'll never live that way
And that's ok they're just afraid to change

When you feel life ain't worth living
You've got to stand up
Take a look around look up way to the sky hell yeah
And when your deepest thoughts are broken
Keep on dreamin' boy 'cause when you stop dreamin' it's time to die

And as we all play parts of tomorrow Lord no
Some ways we'll work and other ways we'll play yeah
But I know we can't all stay here forever
So I'm gonna write my words on the face of today
And then they'll paint it

And oh as I fade away
They'll all look at me and say
They'll say Hey look at him
And where he is these days?
When life is hard you have to change
When life is hard you have to change mmm
