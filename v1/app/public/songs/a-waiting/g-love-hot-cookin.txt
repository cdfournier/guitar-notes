Don't you let the heat out of oven lord
It takes a while to build the fire
Don't let 'em cool ya down
Don't let 'em cool ya down

'Cause there's some hot cookin' that's goin' on tonight
And the temperature is rising just right
All I got to do is keep this fire burning bright
I think I might

'Cause If you put the fuel into the fire
And you start a chain reaction
Which is burning me toss and turnin' me through the night

My temperature is rising fast the feeling strong I can't mask
It's time for you to melt into desire

'Cause there's some hot cookin' that's goin on tonight
And the temperature is rising just right
All I got to do is keep this fire burning bright
And I think I might

My momma always said don't play with fire
Don't you go and burn this whole house down
'Cause I'm about to strike this match put paper on the fire
So you better run and call some one to come

My fevers pitching
And I'm not so sure just what I'm takin' bout
I put my foot into my mouth I don't know what I'm saying

But now is not the time for words
So forget all those things you heard
It's time for you to melt into the fire

'Cause there's some hot cookin' that's goin' on tonight
And the temperature is rising just right
All I got to do is keep this fire burning bright
And I think I might
Yes I think I might
Oh I think I might
