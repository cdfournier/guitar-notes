Em                       G
She started a blaze from one tiny spark
C               Em
I didn't even detect
Em                      D
She loved the light was dismayed by the dark
G                              A
The stars though she seemed to respect

    A                            Em
The faint light that flutters at night to the earth
G                          D
Would land in her eyes and collect
A                        Em
Luminous creatures she'd find in the surf
G                  D
I never thought to inspect

A                        Em
Pebbles and marbles like things on my mind
G                    D
Seem to get lost and harder to find
A                    Em
When I am alone I am inclined
G                     D
If I find a pebble in sand
C
To think that it fell from my hand

Em                G
She gave me ideas planted the seed
C                           Em
But she never stopped to reflect
Em                       D
The course that she's on wherever it leads
G             A
I never would redirect

A                        Em
Pebbles and marbles like words from a friend
G                          D
Make us hold tight but are lost in the end
A                   Em
When we're alone we all seem to tend
G                      D
If we find a marble in dust
C
To wish someone left it for us

A                        Em
Pebbles and marbles like things on my mind
G                    D
Seem to get lost and harder to find
A                    Em
When I am alone I am inclined
G                     D
If I find a pebble in sand
C
To think that it fell from my hand

A                        Em           G    D
Pebbles and marbles like things on my mind
A                        Em           G    D
Pebbles and marbles like things on my mind
A                        Em           G    D
Pebbles and marbles like things on my mind
A                        Em           G    D
Pebbles and marbles like things on my mind
