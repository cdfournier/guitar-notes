All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
I like watching the puddles gather rain
And all I can do
Is just pour some tea for two
And speak my point of view
But it's not sane
It's not sane

I just want someone to say to me
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll always be there when you wake, yeah, yeah
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today, hey
So stay with me and I'll have it made (I'll have it made)

And I don't understand why I sleep all day
And I start to complain that there's no rain
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape
Escape
Escape
Escape

All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
You don't like my point of view and I'm insane
It's not sane
It's not sane

I just want someone to say to me
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll always be there when you wake, yeah, yeah
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today, hey
So stay with me and I'll have it made

I'll have it made (I'll have it made)
And I'll have it made (I'll have it made)
Oh no, no
You know we're really gonna
Really gonna have it made
You know we'll have it made
