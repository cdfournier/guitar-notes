One laugh in the middle of a struggle
A diamond at the bottom of a puddle
Did you ever stare at the moon till you saw double
I hear you walk away from trouble

Good love there ain't no denying
I said bad love somebody ain't trying
Did you ever walk someplace just to take time
Or take the fast road and get going

Then the rules break
There's no mistake
These are precious times
You and I we walk the line

I looked in a frying pan
I sang a song
I looked at a dying man
He sang along

We got mountains
We got beaches
We got a love that makes us mad
Love that has to teach us

I looked in a frying pan
I sang a song
I looked at a dying man
He sang along

Then the rules break
There's no mistake
These are precious times
You and I we walk the line
