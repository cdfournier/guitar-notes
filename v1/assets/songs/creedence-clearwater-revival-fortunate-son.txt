Some folks are born made to wave the flag
They're red white and blue
And when the band plays Hail to the Chief
They point the cannon at you Lord

It ain't me it ain't me
I ain't no senator's son son
It ain't me it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one

Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Lord don't they help themselves yeah
But when the taxman comes to the door
The house look a like a rummage sale

It ain't me it ain't me
I ain't no millionaire's son no no
It ain't me it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one

Yeah some folks inherit star-spangled eyes
They send you down to war
And when you ask 'em how much should we give
They only answer more more more

It ain't me it ain't me
I ain't no military son son
It ain't me it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one one

It ain't me it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one
It ain't me it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one
