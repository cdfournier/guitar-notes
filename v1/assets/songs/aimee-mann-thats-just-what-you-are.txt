In our endeavor we are never seeing eye to eye
No guts to sever so forever may we wave good-bye
And you're always telling me that it's my turn to move
When I wonder what could make the needle jump the groove

I won't fall for the oldest trick in the book
So don't sit there and think you're off of the hook
By saying there is no use changing
'Cause that's just what you are
That's just what you are

Acting steady always ready to defend your fears
What's the matter with the truth did I offend your ears
By suggesting that a change might be a thing to try
Like it would kill you just to try and be a nicer guy

It's not like you would lose some critical piece
If somehow you moved point A to point be
Maintaining there is no point Changing
'Cause that's just what you are
That's just what you are

Now I could talk to you 'til I'm blue in the face
But we still would arrive at the very same place
With you running around and me out of the race

So maybe you're right nobody can take
Something older than time and hope you could make
It better that would be a mistake

So take it just so far
'Cause that's just what you are
That's just what you are
That's just what you are

Acting steady always ready
To defend your fears
What's the matter with the truth
Did I offend your ears
You're like a sleepwalking man
It's a danger to wake you
Even when it is apparent
Where your actions will take you
And that's just what you are
That's just what you are
And that's just what you are
That's just what you are
That's just what you are
