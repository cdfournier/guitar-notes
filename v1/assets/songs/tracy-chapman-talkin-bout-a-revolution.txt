Don't you know
They're talking about a revolution
It sounds like a whisper
Don't you know
Talking about a revolution
It sounds like a whisper

While they're standing in the welfare lines
Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation
Wasting time in the unemployment lines
Sitting around waiting for a promotion

Don't you know
Talking about a revolution
It sounds like a whisper

Poor people gonna rise up
And get their share
Poor people gonna rise up
And take what's theirs

Don't you know you better run run run run run run
Run run run run run run
Oh I said you better run run run run run run
Run run run run run run

'Cause finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' 'bout a revolution
'Cause finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' 'bout a revolution oh no
Talkin' 'bout a revolution oh

I've been standing in the welfare lines
Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation
Wasting time in the unemployment lines
Sitting around waiting for a promotion

Don't you know
Talking about a revolution
It sounds like a whisper

And finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' 'bout a revolution
Yes finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' 'bout a revolution oh no
Talkin' 'bout a revolution oh no
Talkin' 'bout a revolution oh no
