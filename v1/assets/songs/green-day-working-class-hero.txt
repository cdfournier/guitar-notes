As soon as you're born they make you feel small
By givin' you no time instead of it all
'Til the pain is so big you feel nothin' at all

A working class hero is somethin' to be
A working class hero is somethin' to be

They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate if you're clever and despise a fool
'Til you're so fuckin' crazy you can't follow their rules

A working class hero is somethin' to be
A working class hero is somethin' to be

When they've tortured and scared you for 20 odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
When you can't really function you're so full of fear

A working class hero is somethin' to be
A working class hero is somethin' to be

They keep you doped with religion and sex and TV
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
But you're still fuckin' peasants as far as I can see

A working class hero is somethin' to be
A working class hero is somethin' to be

There's room at the top they're tellin' you still
But first you must learn how to smile as they kill
If you wanna be like all the folks on the hill

A working class hero is somethin' to be
A working class hero is somethin' to be
A working class hero is somethin' to be
A working class hero is somethin' to be
A working class hero is somethin' to be
A working class hero is somethin' to be

If you want to be a hero well just follow me
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
