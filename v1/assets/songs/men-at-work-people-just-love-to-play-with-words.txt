I'm not trying to impress you with my lies
They don't mean nothing at all
It's just another expression of mine
It don't mean nothing at all
Mystifying oh no crystallizing you know

People just love to play with words
People just love to play haven't you heard
People just love to play with words
People just love to play haven't you heard

There are two sides a win or loss
What's two down and four across
Analyzing and implying you know

People just love to play with words
People just love to play haven't you heard
People just love to play with words
People just love to play haven't you heard

(People just love to play)
People they love to
(People just love to play)
Haven't you heard

(People just love to play)
Play with words
(People just love to play)
Haven't you heard

(People just love to play)
With words
(Oh people just love to play)
Haven't you heard haven't you heard

(People just love to play)
With words
(Ahh people just love to play)
People love to play

(People just love to play)
People they love to
(People just love to play)
People love to play

(People just love to play)
People they love to
