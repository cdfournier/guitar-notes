I feed from the bottom you feed from the top
  D                     G
I live upon morsels you happen to drop
    E                         A
And coffee that somehow leaks out of your cup
   D                           G
If nothing comes down then I'm forced to swim up

D                      G
On the way upwards the colors come back
    D                       G
But all along the bottom is blue grey and black
    E                       A
The darkness is cold and perception goes wrong
        D                    G
And the night seems to go on incredibly long

     D       C  G       D           C A
So I ask you why if I'm swimming by
Am        Bm           C             D
Don't you see anything you'd like to try

D                     G
Pantomime mixtures of heaven and earth
D                        G
Jumbled events that have less than no worth
E                     A
Time in the forest to dig under rocks
   D                  G
Or float in the ocean asleep in a box

   D                       G
Or sink just below all the churning and froth
    D                           G
And swim to the light source or fly like a moth
   E                         A
So toss away stuff you don't need in the end
    D                         G
But keep what's important and know who's your friend

     D       C  G       D           C A
So I ask you why if I'm swimming by
Am        Bm           C                  D   C G
Don't you see anything that you'd like to try
       D           C A
If I'm swimming by
