Things are falling down on me
C              G            
Heavy things I could not see

C G C G

C              G
When I finally came around
C               G                
Something small would pin me down

C G C G

       F             G
When I tried to step aside
I moved to where they hoped I'd be

Vanessa calls me on the phone
F                    C
Reminding me I'm not alone
F                    C
I fuss and quake and cavitate
C                          G
I try to speak and turn to stone

Tilly reaches through my vest
F                             C
To do the thing that she does best
F                       C
She probes and tears my ventricles
C                       G
Steals my one remaining breath

C                  G
Things are falling down on me

F                       C
Stumbling as I fall from grace
F                      C
She needs my vision to replace
F                               C
Her ailing sight throughout the night
C                       G
Leaving two holes in my face

Mary was a friend I'd say
F               C
Till one summer day
F                         C
She borrowed everything I owned
C                   G
And then simply ran away

C                  G
Things are falling down on me
C              G            
Heavy things I could not see
