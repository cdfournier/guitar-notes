Ooo I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy that you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I loved you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday

Ooo I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Ooo I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey honey yeah

You know that a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you found someone else

Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Ooo I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey honey yeah

People say you believe half from what you see
Non non none from what you hear
I can't help being confused
If it's true won't tell me here
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy that you knew before

Ooo I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Ooo I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to loss my mind
Honey honey yeah

Ooo I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Ooo I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Ooo I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Ahh I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind honey honey yeah
