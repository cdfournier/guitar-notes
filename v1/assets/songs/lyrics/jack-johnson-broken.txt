With everything ahead of us we left everything behind
But nothing that we needed at least
Not at this time
And I feeling that I'm feeling well
Is feeling like my life was finally mine
With nothing to go back to
We just continue to drive

Without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
I said without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side

I didn't know what I was looking for
So I didn't know what I'd find
I didn't know what I was missing
I guess you've been just a little to kind
And if I find just what I need
Put a little piece in my mind
Maybe you've been looking to
Maybe you don't even need to try

Without you I was broken
And I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
I said without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side

With everything in the past fading faster and faster until it was gone
Thought that I was loosing so much more than I knew all along
But everything I was working for only worth nickels and dimes
But if I had had a minute for every hour that I wasted I'd be rich in time
I'd be doing fine

Cause without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
So without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
So without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
I said without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
