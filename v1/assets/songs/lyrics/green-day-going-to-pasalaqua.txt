Here we go again
Infatuation touches me just when I thought that it would end
Oh but then again it seems much more than that but
I'm not sure exactly what you're thinking

Well I toss and turn all night thinking of your ways of affection
But to find that it's not different at all
Well I throw away my past mistakes and contemplate my future
That's when I say
What the heck

Would it last forever
You and I together
Hand and hand
We run away far away
I'm in for nasty weather
But I'll take whatever you can
Give that comes my way far away

Far away
