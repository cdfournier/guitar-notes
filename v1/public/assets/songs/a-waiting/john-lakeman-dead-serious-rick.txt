There's a cool breeze that blows wherever Cool Rick goes
But he just got dead serious on me

I startled him and made him sick
I took the cool out of Cool Rick
And now he's dead serious Rick

If I needed you would you come to me
Put your head on my chest and help me rest
Like Charlie
Now that you really know me

But it's not fair to compare you to Charlie man
In regard to the tenderness he gave me
It's easier for him to be near to me
He doesn't understand anything about ethics and he's probably had extensive training

But if I needed you would you come to me
Put your head on my chest and help me rest
Like Charlie
Now that you really know me

I'm sorry man
I'm sorry I killed Cool Rick
