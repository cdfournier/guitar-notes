I used to love her but I had to kill her
I used to love her oh yeah but I had to kill her
I had to put her six feet under
And I can still hear her complain

I used to love her oh yeah but I had to kill her
I used to love her ooh yeah but I had to kill her
I knew I'll miss her so I had to keep her
She's buried right in my back yard

I used to love her but I had to kill her
I used to love her ooh yeah but I had to kill her
She bitched so much she drove me nuts
And now I'm happier this way

I used to love her but I had to kill her
I used to love her ooh yeah but I had to kill her
I had to put her six ooh feet under
And I can still hear her complain
