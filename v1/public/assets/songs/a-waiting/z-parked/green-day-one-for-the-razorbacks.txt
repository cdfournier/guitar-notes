Juliet's trying
To find out what she wants but she don't know
Experience has got her down

Well look this direction
I know it's not perfection it's just me
I wanna bring you up again now

'Cause I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price I'll pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in

Juliet's crying
Well now she's realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust

I know I am crazy
And a bit lazy but I will try
To bring you up again somehow

'Cause I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price I'll pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in

Juliet's crying
Well now she's realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust

I know I am crazy
And a bit lazy but I will try
To bring you up again somehow

'Cause I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price I'll pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in
