I don't know what the world may need
But I'm sure as hell that is starts with me
And that's a wisdom
I've laughed at

I don't know what the world may want
But a good stiff drink it surely don't
So I think I'll go and fix myself a tall one

Cause what the world needs now
Is a new kind of tension
Cause the old one just bores me to death

Cause what the world needs now
Is another folk singer
Like I need a hole in my head

I don't know what the world may need
But a V8 engine is a good start for me
Think I'll drive to find a place
To be surly

I don't know what the world may want
But some words of wisdom could comfort us
Think I'll leave that up to someone wiser

Cause what the world needs now
Are some true words of wisdom
Like La La La La La

Cause what the world needs now
Is another folk singer
Like I need a hole in my head

I don't know what the world may need
And I never grasped your complexities
I'd be happy just to get your attention

And I don't know what the world may want
But your long sweet body lying next
To mine could certainly raise my spirits

Cause what the world needs now
Is a new Frank Sinatra
So I can get you in bed

Cause what the world needs now
Is another folk singer
Like I need a hole in my head

What the world needs now
What the world needs now
Is another folk singer
Like I need a hole in my head

What the world needs now
What the world needs now
Is a new Frank Sinatra
So I can get you in bed

What the world needs now
What the world needs now
Is another folk singer
Like I need a hole in my head

What the world needs now
What the world needs now
Is another folk singer
Like I need a hole in my head
