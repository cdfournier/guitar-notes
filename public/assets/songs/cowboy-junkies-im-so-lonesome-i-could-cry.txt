D        F#m      Bm          D
Hear the lonesome whippoorwill
D              F#m     Am
His song's too blue to fly
    G        Gm         D       Bm
The midnight train is a-winding low
Bm     D        A       D
I'm so lonesome I could cry

D          F#m    Bm           D
I've never seen a night so long
D               F#m      Am
When time keeps crawling by
    G       Gm     D        Bm
The moon is gone behind the clouds
   D        A        D
To hide his face and cry

D        F#m         Bm        D
Have you ever seen a robin weep
D                F#m       Am
When leaves have turned to brown
     G       Gm       D       Bm
Like me he's lost his will to live
Bm     D        A       D
I'm so lonesome I could cry

D F#m Bm - D F#m Am - G Gm D Bm - D A D

D           F#m  Bm          D
The silence of a falling star
D           F#m    Am
Lights up a purple haze
    G    Gm     D         Bm
And as I wonder where you are
Bm     D        A       D
I'm so lonesome I could cry
