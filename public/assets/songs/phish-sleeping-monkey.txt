C
The feeling's not the same
C            Am
In fact it's getting pretty tame
F                           G
It's just not that great anymore

C
I guess I'll go outside
C          Am
And flag a weasel for a ride
F                          G
And take it on down to the shore

C
Wallowing in fear
C            Am
The days and weeks that you're not here
F                      G
Was all the waiting in vain

C
The day that you arrive
C           Am
My sleeping monkey is revived
F                            G
But you sent him home on the train

C
Home on the train
C                             G
Why'd you send my monkey on a train
C
The day that you arrive
C           F
My sleeping monkey is revived
    C            G           C
But you sent him home on the train

C
Home on the train
C                             G
Why'd you send my monkey on a train
C
The day that you arrive
C           F
My sleeping monkey is revived
    C            G           C
But you sent him home on the train
