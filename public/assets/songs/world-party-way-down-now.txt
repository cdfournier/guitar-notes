A
Inside my TV I
G
Never stop to wonder why
    D
I'm way down now
    G
I'm way down now

     A
Some faceless git on the screen
         G
The most honest man I've ever seen
    D
I'm way down now
    G
I'm way down now

         D
Won't you show me
A         G    D     A G
Something true today
G           D
Come on and show me
A      G     D
Anything but this

A
  She took us by the hand
G
Hell was the promised land
    D
I'm way down now
    G
I'm way down now

A
  I'm lying by the road
G
Cause she cut off all my clothes
    D
I'm way down now
    G
I'm way down now

         D
Won't you show me
A         G    D     A G
Something true today
G           D
Come on and show me

G
Inside my future life
A
  What I see just makes me cry
    D
I'm way down now
    G
I'm way down now

    G
The clocks will all run backwards
G       A
All the sheep will have two heads
    D
And Thursday night and Friday
D          G
Will be on Tuesday night instead

G
And all the times will keep on changing
        A
And the movement will increase
        D
There's something about the living babe
     G
That sends me off my feet

        G
There's breeding in the sewers
        A
And the rats are on their way
        D
They're clouding up the images
G
Of my perfect day

D
And I know I'm not alone
A
And I know I'm not alone
G
And I know I'm not alone

D A      G     D
  Anything but this
D
Can you hear me I said

A
Inside my TV I
G
Never stop to wonder why
    D
I'm way down now
    G
I'm way down now

     A
Some faceless git on the screen
         G
The most honest man I've ever seen
    D
I'm way down now
    G
I'm way down now
