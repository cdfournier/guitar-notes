Em D Em D

Em
From the very first moment I saw you
D
That's when I knew
Em
All the dreams I held in my heart
D
Had suddenly come true

Em
Knock me over stone cold sober
D
Not a thing I could say or do
G                   D
Cause baby when I'm walking with you now
C
My eyes are so wide

G                           D
Like you reached right into my head
C
And turned on the light inside
Bm
Turning on the light
Bm        C
Inside my mind hey

G
Come on baby it's all right
G      D
Sunday Monday day or night
Em
Written blue on white it's plain to see
C
Be mine be mine
G
That rainy shiny night or day
D
What's the difference anyway
A                               C
Honey til your heart belongs to me

Em
If I had some influence girl
         D
With the powers that be
Em
I'd have them fire that arrow at you
          D
Like they fired it right at me

Em                        D
And maybe when your heart and soul are burning
D
You might see
G               D
That every time I'm talking with you
C
It's always over too soon

G             D
That everyday feels so incomplete
C
Til you walk into the room
Bm
Say the word now girl
Bm             C
I'll jump that moon hey

G
Come on baby it's ok
G           D
Rainy shiny night or day
Em
There's nothing in the way now
Em        C
Don't you see
C
Be mine be mine
G
Winter summer day or night
D
Centigrade or Fahrenheit
A                    C
Baby till your heart belongs to me
C
Be mine be mine

G
Thursday Friday short or long
D
When you got a love so strong
Em                      C
How can it be wrong now mercy me
C
Be mine be mine
G
Jumping Jesus holy cow
D
What's the difference anyhow
A              C
Baby till your heart belongs to me
