I don't know what the world may need
D       G
But I'm sure as hell that is starts with me
G            C     G      D
And that's a wisdom  I've laughed at

D
I don't know what the world may want
D     G
But a good stiff drink it surely don't
G    C                 G            D
So I think I'll go and fix myself a tall one

But a V8 engine is a good start for me

Think I'll leave that up to  someone wiser

D
Cause what the world needs now

I'd be happy just to get your attention

D        G
But your long sweet body lying next
G             C        G         D
To mine could certainly raise my spirits
