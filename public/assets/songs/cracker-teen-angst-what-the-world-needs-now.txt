I don't know what the world may need
G
But I'm sure as hell that is starts with me
G            C      G      D
And that's a wisdom   I've laughed at

D
I don't know what the world may want
G
But a good stiff drink it surely don't
G               C      G            D
So I think I'll go and fix myself a tall one

D
Cause what the world needs now
G
Is a new kind of tension
G             D        G           D
Cause the old one just bores me to death

G
But a V8 engine is a good start for me
G          C               G           D
Think I'll drive to find a place to be surly

D
I don't know what the world may want
G
But some words of wisdom could comfort us
G          C               G         D
Think I'll leave that up to  someone wiser

D
Cause what the world needs now
G
Are some true words of wisdom
G    C            G         D
Like la la la la  la la la  la la

D
And I don't know what the world may want
G
But your long sweet body lying next
G             C        G         D
To mine could certainly raise my spirits

Is a new Frank Sinatra
   C     G          D
So I can get you in bed
