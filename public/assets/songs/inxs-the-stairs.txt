C                 F
In a room above a busy street
C               F
The echoes of a life
C                     F
The fragments and the accidents
C            F
Separated by incidents

F                  G
Listened to by the walls
F                 G
We share the same spaces
F               G
Repeated in the corridors
F                   G
Performing the same movements

C                  F
The nature of your tragedy
C                      F
Is chained around your neck
C                  F
Do you lead or are you lead
F       G
Are you sure that you don't care

G         C               F
There are reasons here to give your life
C                  F
And follow in your way

The passion lives to keep your faith
C                        F
Though all are different all are great

F              G
Climbing as we fall
F               G
We dare to hold on to our fate
F                  G
And steal away our destiny
F                             G
To catch ourselves with quiet grace
