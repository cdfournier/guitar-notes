G      C         Am             D             G
I miss you and I wonder how you feel about me too
G      C                     Am
Do you miss the way we would play
    D              G
And waste our time away
G      C       Am                D             G
Suddenly we're apart and I can't see you every night
G           C                    Am
Though we'd fight I loved you so much
    D                 Em
Now I can't feel your touch

   Bm         Em
Oh girlfriend
       Bm     C
That's the end
C       Am                F
And I'm lost without your love oh love

G       C          Am         D                G
In your arms I was happy as a little boy could be
G      C                   Am
Taking pills and mellowing out
    D              G
Now I just want to shout
C
For your love
C         Am               D              G
Cause I'm drifting further from you every day
G       C                   Am
Driving by your place every night
  D            Em
I used to feel alright

   Bm         Em
Oh girlfriend
       Bm     C
That's the end
C       Am                F
And I'm lost without your love oh love

G
Feeling fancies every night
G                    F
When I dreamed to be alright oh love oh love

G C Am D - G C Am D - G C Am D - G C Am D

   Bm         Em
Oh girlfriend
       Bm     C
That's the end
C       Am                F
And I'm lost without your love

G       C          Am         D                G
In your arms I was happy as a little boy could be
G      C                   Am
Taking pills and mellowing out
    D              G
Now I just want to shout

G C Am    D              G
      Now I just want to shout
G C Am    D              G
      Now I just want to shout

      Now I just want to shout
G C Am    D              G
      Now I just want to shout
