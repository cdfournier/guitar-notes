G Em C G

G
We walked the loneliest mile
Em
We smile without any style
C
We kiss all together wrong
G
No intention

G
We lie about each other's drinks
Em
We live without each other
C
Thinking what anyone would do
G
Without me and you

G           D
It's like I told you
C                   G
Only the lonely can play

G
So hold on here we go
Em
Hold on to nothing we know
C
I feel so lonely
G
Way up here

G
You mention the time we were together
Em                 C
So long ago well I don't remember
C                G
All I know is it makes me feel good now

G           D
It's like I told you
C                   G
Only the lonely can play
G        D
Only the lonely
C                   G
Only the lonely can play

G Em C G

G        D
Only the lonely
C                   G
Only the lonely can play
G           D
It's like I told you
C                   G
Only the lonely can play

G        D
Only the lonely
C                   G
Only the lonely can play
