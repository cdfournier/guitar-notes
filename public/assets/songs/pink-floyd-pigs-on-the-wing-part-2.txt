G               C
You know that I care
C               G
What happens to you
G                   C
And I know that you care
C      G
For me too

G    A
So I don't feel alone
A      A7
Or the weight of the stone
G             C                       D       G
Now that I've found somewhere safe to bury my bone
    Am       F       Am          F    C       Am
And any fool knows a dog needs a home
  D                        G
A shelter from pigs on the wing
