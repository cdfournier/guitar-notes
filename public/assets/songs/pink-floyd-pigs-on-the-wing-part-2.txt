G               C
You know that I care
C               G
What happens to you
G                   C
And I know that you care
C      G
For me too


G    A
So I don't feel alone
A      A7
Or the weight of the stone
G             C
Now that I've found
C                 D       G
Somewhere safe to bury my bone
    Am       F
And any fool knows
Am            F    C Am
A dog needs a home
  D                        G
A shelter from pigs on the wing
