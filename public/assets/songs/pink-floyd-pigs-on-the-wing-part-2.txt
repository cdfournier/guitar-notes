G               C    F
You know that I care
C               G   C G
What happens to you
G                   C    F
And I know that you care
C      G   C G
For me too
G    A
So I don't feel alone
A
Or the weight of the stone
G
Now that I've found
C                 D       G
Somewhere safe to bury my bone
    Am       F
And any fool knows
Am            F    C Am
A dog needs a home
  D                    C   G
A shelter from pigs on the wing
