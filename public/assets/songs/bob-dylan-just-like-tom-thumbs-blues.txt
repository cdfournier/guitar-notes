G
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez
G        C           G
And it's Easter time too
G
And your gravity fails
G   C                         G
And negativity don't pull you through
G
Don't put on any airs
C                              G
When you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
G             D
They got some hungry women there
D           C                        G
And they'll really make a mess outta you

G
If you see Saint Annie
C                        G
Please tell her thanks a lot
G
I cannot move
G  C                         G
My fingers they are all in a knot
G
I don't have the strength
C                          G
To get up and take another shot
G      D
And my best friend the doctor
D     C                            G
Won't even tell me what it is I've got

G
Sweet Melinda
C                                    G
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom
G
She speaks good English
C                           G
And invites you up into her room
G
And you're so kind and careful
C                    G
Not to go to her too soon
G       D
And she takes your voice
D   C                         G
And leaves you howling at the moon

G
Up on Housing Project Hill
C                      G
It's either fortune or fame
G
You must pick one or the other
C                             G
Neither of them are what they claim
G
If you're looking to get silly
C                                    G
You better go back to from where you came
G           D
Because the cops don't need you
D   C                   G
And man they expect the same

G
Now the authorities
C                           G
They just stand around and boast
G
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
C                G
Into leaving his post
G
And picking up Angel
C                         G
Who just arrived from the coast
G   D
Who looked so fine at first
D   C                        G
But left looking just like a ghost

G
I started out on Burgundy
C                       G
But soon hit the harder stuff
G
Everybody said they'd stand behind me
C                 G
When the game got rough
G
But the joke was on me
C                                      G
There was nobody even there to call my bluff
G         D
I'm going back to New York City
D C                   G
I do believe I've had enough
