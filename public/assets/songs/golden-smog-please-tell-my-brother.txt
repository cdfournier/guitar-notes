D                         A         D
Please tell my brothers I love them still
D        Bm           G
Over the mountains on their phone bill
G                  D
I should call more often
D                     G
But they know I never will
G              D          A         D
Please tell my brothers I love them still

D                       A        D
Please tell my sister I miss her too
D             Bm          G
My nieces and nephews and their swimming pools
G            D
When I think about her
D             G
Her skies are blue
G              D        A        D
Please tell my sister I miss her too

D                       A        D
Please tell my father I love him still
D          Bm           G
Forget the railroad and all those bills
G            D
Head for the cooler
D              G
And drink your fill
G              D        A        D
Please tell my father I love him still

D                    A            D
Listen dear mother I miss you the most
D        Bm          G
And as I travel from coast to coast
G           D
I feel your love and
D           G
I feel your ghost
G           D        A            D
Listen dear mother I miss you the most
G           D        A            D
Listen dear mother I miss you the most
