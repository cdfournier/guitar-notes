G    A
Blue morning blue morning
A          G
Wrapped in strands of fist and bone
A
Curiosity kitten
A                    G
Doesn't have to mean you're on your own

G       A
You can look outside your window

He doesn't have to know
G      A
We can talk awhile baby
A      G
We can take it nice and slow

All your life is such a shame
G        D              G
All your love is just a dream

G       A
Are you happy where you're sleeping
A       G
Does he keep you safe and warm
G       A
Does he tell you when you're sorry
A       G
Does he tell you when you're wrong

G         A
I've been watching you for hours
A         G
It's been years since we were born
G       A
We were perfect when we started

I've been wondering where we've gone

All your love is just a dream

G          A
I dreamt I saw you walking
A        G
Up a hillside in the snow
G       A
Casting shadows on the winter sky 
A      G
As you stood there counting crows

G       A
One for sorrow two for joy
A         G
Three for girls and four for boys
G        A
Five for silver six for gold and
A           G
Seven for a secret never to be told

G         A
There's a bird that nests inside you
A             G
Sleeping underneath your skin
G        A
When you open up your wings to speak
A            G
I wish you'd let me in

Open up your eyes
D               G
You can see the flames flames flames
G       D
Of your wasted life
D              G
You should be ashamed shamed shamed

G                 D
You don't want to waste your life
D             G

I walk along these hillsides in the summer beneath the sunshine
G
I am feathered by the moonlight falling down on me
