       C                 Am
Well I heard there was a secret chord
     C                   Am
That David played and it pleased the Lord
    F                G              C     G
But you don't really care for music do ya
        C                  F          G
Well it goes like this the fourth the fifth
    Am                 F
The minor fall and the major lift
    G            E              Am
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

     F
Hallelujah
     Am
Hallelujah

          C                        Am
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
    C               Am
You saw her bathing on the roof
    F              G             C        G
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
        C               F       G
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
        Am                        F
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
    G                  E             Am
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

     F

     C              Am
Well baby I've been here before
     C                       Am
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
  F            G              C       G
I used to live alone before I knew ya
         C                     F      G
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
    Am            F
And love is not a victory march
       G               E           Am
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

     F

           C                   Am
Well there was a time when you let me know
       C            Am
What's really going on below
    F             G               C     G
But now you never show that to me do ya
      C             F        G
But remember when I moved in you
        Am            F
And the holy dove was moving too
    G               E             Am
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

     F
Hallelujah

     C               Am
Well maybe there's a God above
    C             Am
But all I've ever learned from love
    F                G           C       G
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
         C                  F      G
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
     Am                 F
It's not somebody who's seen the light
       G               E           Am
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
