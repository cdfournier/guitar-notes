D G

G           D      G
Crazy rides rockets
G               D   G
Who has a magic wand
G              D      G
Empty out your pockets
G               D   G
Words without a song

Em                    G             D     G
I myself have found a real rival in myself
Em                G                D     G
I am hoping for a re-arrival of my health

G            D      G
Sleeping eye sockets
G              D    G
Baby suck your thumb
G                   D     G
I'll keep you in my locket
G                D    G
A string I never strum

Em
It's become so obvious
G                       D       G
You are so oblivious to yourself

F#m Em               D
    You're tied in a knot
F#m     G             Em
But I'm not gonna get caught
Em        D          F#m
Calling a pot kettle black
Em             G
Every song's a comeback
Em               G               D G
Every moment's a little bit later

G    D          G
Lazy locomotives
G                D   G
Wherever you may roll
G                   D     G
I think you have no motive
G                  D   G
I know you have no home

Em
It's become so obvious
G                       D       G
You are so oblivious to yourself

F#m Em               D
    You're tied in a knot
F#m     G             Em
But I'm not gonna get caught
Em        D          F#m
Calling a pot kettle black
Em             G
Every song's a comeback
Em               G               D G
Every moment's a little bit later
Em               G               D G
Every moment's a little bit later
Em               G               D G
Every moment's a little bit later
Em               G               D G
Every moment's a little bit later
Em               G               D G
Every moment's a little bit later
