G
That young boy without a name
G
Anywhere I'd know his face
Em
In this city the kid's my favorite
C                     D
I've seen him seen him
D               G
I see him every day

G
I've seen him run outside
G
Looking for a place to hide
Em
From his father the kid half-naked
C                   D
And I said to myself
D                    G
Oh what's the matter here

    C            D       G         Em
I'm tired of the excuses everybody uses
Em         C     D           G
He's their kid I stay out of it
    C        D       G           C
But who gave you the right to do this

G
We live on Morgan Street
G                    Em
Just ten feet between and his mother
Em                      C                 D
I never see her but her screams and curses
D                 G
I hear them every day

G
Threats like If you don't mind
G
I will beat on your behind
Em
Slap you
Em                     C              D

Oh what's the matter here

    C            D       G         Em
I'm tired of the excuses everybody uses
Em        C   D                        G
He's your kid do as you see as you see fit
G       C    D            G       Em
But get this through that I don't approve
G           C           D             G
Of what you did to your own flesh and blood

G - G Em G - C D G

    C            D       G         Em
I have heard the excuses everybody uses
Em        C   D             G
He's your kid do as you see fit
G       C    D            G       Em
But get this through that I don't approve
G           C           D             G
Of what you did to your own flesh and blood

G                   C          G
If you don't sit in your chair straight
G                        C         G
I'll take this belt from around my waist
G                        C       G
And don't you think that I won't use it

C             D
Answer me and take your time
G                 Em
What could be the awful crime
   C           D           G
He could do at so young an age

G          C
If I'm the only witness to your madness
G             Em               C
Offer me some words to balance out
C      D              G
What I see and what I hear

G         Em       C     D               G
All these cold and cruel things that you do
G         Em     C       D             G
I suppose you do because he belongs to you
G      Em      C            D       G
And instead of love and the feel of warmth
G      Em    C         D        G
You've given him these cuts and sores
G    Em         C    D            G
That don't heal with time or with age

C     D         G
  And I want to say
G       C              D
Want to say hey hey hey
D                 G
What's the matter here

G                C          D
But I don't dare say hey hey
D                 G
What's the matter here

G                C   D      G
But I don't dare say hey hey
