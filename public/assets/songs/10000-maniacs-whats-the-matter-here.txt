That young boy without a name I'd know his face
G       Em       G
In this city the kid's my favorite
     C          D             G
I've seen him I see him every day

G                                                Em
Seen him run outside looking for a place to hide from his father
G                      C              D                    G
The kid half naked and said to myself oh what's the matter here

    C            D       G            
I'm tired of the excuses everybody uses 
G          C     D           G
He's their kid I stay out of it
    C        D       G           C
But who gave you the right to do this

G
We live on Morgan Street
G                     Em
Just ten feet between and his mother I never see her
        C                                    G
But her screams and curses I hear them every day

G
Threats like If you don't mind I will beat on your behind
Em
Slap you slap you silly
        C   D                    G
Made me say oh what's the matter here

    C            D       G            
I'm tired of the excuses everybody uses 
G          C     D           G
He's their kid I stay out of it
    C        D            G              
But get this through that I don't approve
G           C          D             G
Of what you did to you own flesh and blood

G - G Em G - C D G
C D G C D G - C D G C D G

Em     G            C          G
If you don't sit in your chair straight
     Em        G         C         G
I'll take this belt from around my waist
    Em    G          C       G
And don't think that I won't use it

C             D
Answer me and take your time
G                 Em
What could be the awful crime
   C           D           G
He could do at so young an age

G          C                            G             Em
If I'm the only witness to your madness offer me some words
Em         C          D              G
To balance out what I see and what I hear

G         D        D     G               Em
All these cold and cruel things that you do
Em        C      D                     G
I suppose you do because he belongs to you

G           C               D
And instead of love and the feel of warmth
D      G               Em
You've given him these cuts and sores
     C               D            G
That don't heal with time or with age

C     D         G             C   D                 G
  And I want to say I want to say what's the matter here
G                C   D                 G
But I don't dare say what's the matter here
G                C D G
But I don't dare say
