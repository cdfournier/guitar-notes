C           G
Give you my loving
G            C
Seven days a week
C            G
I'll be your honey
G            C
If you'll be sweet
G              C
I know I'm the only one for you
G               C
I know that you think this is not true

C             G
Man says it's raining
G       C
Raining outside
C       G                     C
I'll be out there in a little while
G
Cause you see
G    C
Rain reminds me of you
G              C
And everything has turned to you

C          G
See you in places
G             C
I'm following you
C         G
You'll be upstairs
G                 C
And I'll be there too
G
Everywhere you go
C
I will follow
G                      C
I know it won't be the same tomorrow

C              G
People give me warnings
G              C
Stay away from you
C               G
They say you'll hurt me
G                    C
I don't think that's true
G                       C
Discomfort arouses when I speak of you
G                                  C
As if you've been saying something bad about me

C      G
When I see you
G         C
I want to kiss you
C          G
But I know that ain't right
G                 C
So I ask if I can hold you
G         C
Oh babe I need you so bad
G         C   
Oh babe I only want to make you
G
Glad
