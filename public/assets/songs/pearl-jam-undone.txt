A
Last stop on the west coast line
A
South of the northern border
G         D            A
One small corner of my mind
A
Everybody they know me there
A
Don't get any second glances
G       D                   A
Chances are that they don't care

    C              G
The world has come undone
        D         A
Like to change it everyday
C                    G
Change don't come at once
       D                       A
It's a wave building before it breaks

A
Can't wait for election day
A
Witness the occupation
G      D              A
Corporations rule the day
A
Well you know the pendulum throws
A
Farther out to the one side swinging
G      D                    A
Has to sweep back the other way

    C              G
The world has come undone
        D               A
Another day and who can wait
C                    G
Change don't come at once
       D                       A
It's a wave building before it breaks

C        D        A
All this hope and nowhere to go
C       D   C         D           A
This is how I used to feel but no more

    C              G
The world has come undone
       D                 A
Like a game that few can play
C                      G
Change don't come from one
       D                       A
It's a wave building before it breaks
