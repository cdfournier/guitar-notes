Am Dm Am Em - Am Dm C D

Am                  Dm
I count the falling tears
Am                  Em
They fall before my eyes
Am                    Dm
Seems like a thousand years
Am                 Em
Since we broke the ties

Am                Dm
I call you on the phone
Am              Em
But never get a rise
Am               Dm
So sit there all alone
C                D
It's time you realize
D            Am
I'm not your fool

Am             F
(Nobody's fool nobody's fool)
G  C   G  Am           
   I'm no fool
Am             F
(Nobody's fool nobody's fool)
G  C           G  Am           
   Never again no no

Am                 Dm
You take your road I'll take mine
Am                       Em
The paths have both been beaten
Am                        Dm
Searching for a change of pace
Am               Em
Life needs to be sweetened

Am          Dm
I scream my heart out
Am                 Em
Just to make a dime
Am                   Dm
And with that dime I bought your love
    C                   D
But now I've changed my mind
D            Am
I'm not your fool

Am             F
(Nobody's fool nobody's fool)
G  C   G  Am           
   I'm no fool
Am             F
(Nobody's fool nobody's fool)
G  C           G  Am           
   Never again no no

Am             F
(Nobody's fool nobody's fool)
G  C   G  Am           
   I'm no fool
Am             F
(Nobody's fool nobody's fool)

G C G  Am
