Am     Em   G               C  D
I am a poor freezingly cold soul
Am          Em    G          F  G
So far from where I intended to go

F C - F C

Am         Em      G                    C    D
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls
Am          Em    G              F  G
So far from where I'm determined to go

F C - F C

Am              Em     G               C   D
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
Am          Em    G  F  G
      There is no way

F C - F C

Am             Em       G                 C   D
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love
Am         Em            G    F  G
But you see  I've got no charm

F C - F C

Am              Em         G               C   D
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold
Am      Em               G    F  G
Oh this is very clear to you

F C - F C

Am          Em          G            C   D
And you can tell I have never really loved
Am                  Em              G    F  G
You can tell by the way I sleep all day

F C - F C

Am            Em          G          C   D
And all of my life no one gave me anything
Am         Em            G       F  G
No one has ever given me anything

F C - F C

Am            Em         G              C  D
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye
Am                 Em              G    F  G
You must be such a fool to pass me by
