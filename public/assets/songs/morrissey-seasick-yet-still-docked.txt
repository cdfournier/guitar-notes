Bm     F#m  A               D    E
I Bm a poor freezingly cold soul
Bm          F#m   A             G  A
So far from where I intended to go

G D - G D

Bm         F#m     A                    D     E
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls
Bm          F#m   A                 G  A
So far from where I'm determined to go

G D - G D

Bm              F#m    A               D    E
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
Bm    F#m         A  G  A
      There is no way

G D - G D

Bm             F#m      A                 D    E
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love
Bm         F#m     A      G     A
But you see   I've got no charm

G D - G D

Bm              F#m        A               D    E
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold
Bm      F#m     A        G   A
Oh this is very clear to you

G D - G D

Bm          F#m         A            DED
And you can tell I have never really loved
Bm           F#m        A           G   A
You can tell by the way I sleep all day

G D - G D

Bm            F#m         A       D       E
And all of my life no one gave me anything
Bm         F#m  A           G    A
No one has ever given me anything

G D - G D

Bm            F#m        A              D   E
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye
Bm                 F#m     A       G  A
You must be such a fool to pass me by
