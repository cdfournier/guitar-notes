D G A

D                   G     A
Swaying room as the music starts
D                    G           A
Strangers making the most of the dark
D                G      A      D   G A
Two by two their bodies become one
D                     G     A
I see you through the smoky air
D                  G            A
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
D                   G       A      Bm
You're so close but still a world away
Bm       G
What I'm dying to say is that

D
I'm crazy for you
A                        Bm
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
G                 D

D    A
It's all brand new

D                 G       A
Trying hard to control my heart
D              G         A
I walk over to where you are
D             G       A        D   G A
Eye to eye we need no words at all
D               G      A
Slowly now we begin to move
D                       G    A
Every breath I'm deeper into you
D               G        A        Bm
Soon we two are standing still in time
Bm     G
If you read my mind you'll see

D
I'm crazy for you
A                        Bm
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
G                 D

A      Bm
