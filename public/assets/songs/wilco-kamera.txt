I need a camera to my eye
G         A
To my eye reminding
G                      A
Which lies have I been hiding
A            D
Which echoes belong

I've counted out
G               D
Days to see how far
A    G             D
I've driven in the dark
A    G            D
With echoes in my heart
A        D           G        D           A
Phone my family tell them I'm lost on the sidewalk
G       A   D
No it's not okay

I smashed a camera I wanna know why
To my eye deciding
Which lies have I been hiding
Which echoes belong

I'm counting on
A heart I know by heart
To walk me through this war
With memories distort
Phone my family tell them I'm lost on the sidewalk
No it's not okay

I'm counted out
And no one knows how far (tell them I'm lost)
I've driven in the dark (tell them I'm lost)
With echoes in my heart (tell them I'm lost)
Phone my family tell them I'm lost yeah I'm lost
And no it's not okay
No it's not okay
No it's not okay
