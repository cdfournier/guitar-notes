I need a camera to my eye
G         A
To my eye reminding
G                           A
Which lies have I been hiding
A            D
Which echoes belong

A
I've counted out
G               D
Days to see how far
A           G      D
I've driven in the dark
A           G     D
With echoes in my heart
A        D      G             D           A
Phone my family tell them I'm lost on the sidewalk
G       A   D
No it's not okay

D
I smashed a camera I wanna know why
G         A
To my eye deciding
G                           A
Which lies have I been hiding
A            D
Which echoes belong

A
I'm counting on
G                 D
A heart I know by heart
A          G            D
To walk me through this war
A         G    D
Where memories distort
A        D      G             D           A
Phone my family tell them I'm lost on the sidewalk
G       A   D
No it's not okay
