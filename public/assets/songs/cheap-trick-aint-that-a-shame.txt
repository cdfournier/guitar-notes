You made me cry when you said goodbye
             G                        D
Ain't that a shame my tears fall like rain
D            G                       A
Ain't that a shame you're the one to blame

    D
You broke my heart now we're apart
             G                        D
Ain't that a shame my tears fall like rain
D            G                       A
Ain't that a shame you're the one to blame

Farewell goodbye although I'll cry
             G                        D
