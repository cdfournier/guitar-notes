Bm           A6
How to fight loneliness
G             F#
Smile all the time
Bm                  A6
Shine you teeth til meaningless
G                 F#
Sharpen them with lies

Em                   A
And whatever's going down
Em              A
Will follow you around
A                    Bm
That's how you fight loneliness

D                  G   F#
You laugh at every joke
Bm                A6
Drag your blanket blindly
G                    F#
Fill your heart with smoke

Em                           A
And the first thing that you want
Em                              A
Will be the last thing you ever need
A                     Bm
Thats how you fight it
