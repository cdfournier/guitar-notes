D
Coming down I'm coming round
     Am
This time I think I'm waking up
D
Give me loud to drown it out
Am
Before the world starts breaking up
G              D    G          D
You change and then you change again
Am             G                 D
Turning like a wheel inside your head

D
Yours and mine and left and right
        Am
There's still two sides to everyone
D
You and I get on with life
    Am
And pray we'll find a better one

Two strangers on the mend

D
Hurry now we're getting out
     Am
This time there's nothing stopping us
D
Leave behind this vacant town
Am
Tonight and let it turn to rust
G              D    G          D
You change and then you change again
