D
Coming down I'm coming round
Am
This time I think I'm waking up
D
Give me loud to drown it out
Am
Before the world starts breaking up
G              D    G          D
You change and then you change again
Am             G                 D
Turning like a wheel inside your head

G
Yours and mine and left and right
        D
There's still two sides to everyone
G
You and I get on with life
    D
And pray we'll find a better one

Hurry now we're getting out
Am
This time there's nothing stopping us
D
Leave behind this vacant town
Am
Tonight and let it turn to rust
