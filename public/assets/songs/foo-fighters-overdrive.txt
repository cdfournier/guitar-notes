D
Coming down I'm coming round
     Am
This time I think I'm waking up
D
Give me loud to drown it out
Am
Before the world starts breaking up

Am             G                 D
Turning like a wheel inside your head

You and I get on with life

And pray we'll find a better one

Leave behind this vacant town
Am
Tonight and let it turn to rust
