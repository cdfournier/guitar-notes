G D Am

G         D             Am
I want to hold the hand inside you
G         D               Am
I want to take the breath that's true
G         D             Am
I look to you and I see nothing
G         D              Am
I look to you to see the truth

G             D              Am
You live your life you go in shadows
G           D                   Am
You'll come apart and you'll go black
G            D               Am
Some kind of night into your darkness
G           D                    Am
Colors your eyes with what's not there

G D         Am
  Fade into you
G D           Am
  Strange you never knew
G D         Am
  Fade into you
G              D           Am
  I think it's strange you never knew

G D Am - G D Am - G D Am C - G D Am

G            D              Am
A stranger's light comes on slowly
G            D               Am
A stranger's heart without a home
G            D               Am
You put your hands into your head
G        D                 Am
And then smiles cover your heart

G D         Am
  Fade into you
G D           Am
  Strange you never knew
G D         Am
  Fade into you
G              D           Am
  I think it's strange you never knew

G D         Am
  Fade into you
G D           Am
  Strange you never knew
G D         Am
  Fade into you
G              D           Am
  I think it's strange you never knew
G              D           Am
  I think it's strange you never knew
