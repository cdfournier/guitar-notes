Bm
Take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the tracks
Bm
Where the viaduct looms like a bird of doom as it shifts and cracks
      Em
Where secrets lie in the border fires in the humming wires
Em                                       Bm
Hey man you know you're never coming back
Bm
Past the square past the bridge past the mills past the stacks
     F#
On a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man
     E                                     Bm
In a dusty black coat with a red right hand

Bm
He'll wrap you in his arms tell you that you've been a good boy
Bm
He'll rekindle all the dreams it took you a lifetime to destroy
      Em
He'll reach deep into the hole heal your shrinking soul
Em                                             Bm
But there won't be a single thing that you can do
Bm
He's a god he's a man he's a ghost he's a guru
        F#
They're whispering his name through this disappearing land
    E                                     Bm
But hidden in his coat is a red right hand

    Bm
You don't have no money he'll get you some
    Bm
You don't have no car he'll get you one
    Em
You don't have no self-respect you feel like an insect
Em                                       Bm
Well don't you worry buddy cause here he comes
Bm
Through the ghettos and the barrio and the Bowery and the slums
  F#
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
E                                          Bm
Stacks of green paper in his red right hand

Bm - Bm - Em - Em Bm - Bm - F# - E Bm

Bm
You'll see him in your nightmares you'll see him in your dreams
Bm
He'll appear out of nowhere but he ain't what he seems
       Em
You'll see him in your head on the TV screen
Em                                      Bm
Hey buddy I'm warning you to turn it off
Bm
He's a ghost he's a god he's a man he's a guru
           F#
You're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan
  E                                        Bm
Designed and directed by his red right hand
