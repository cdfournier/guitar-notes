G           C
You say you want
G                     C
Diamonds on a ring of gold
    G       C
You say you want
     G               C
Your story to remain untold

C           Em          C
But all the promises we make
C        Em            C
From the cradle to the grave
     G     C       G
When all I want is you

    G          C
You say you'll give me
  G                   C
A highway with no one on it
G                       C
Treasure just to look upon it
        G             C
All the riches in the night

    G          C
You say you'll give me
G                 C
Eyes in a moon of blindness
  G                  C
A river in a time of dryness
  G             C
A harbor in the tempest

C           Em          C
But all the promises we make
C        Em            C
From the cradle to the grave
     G     C       G
When all I want is you

G           C
You say you want
     G                C
Your love to work out right
   G                        C
To last with me through the night

G           C
You say you want
G                     C
Diamonds on a ring of gold
     G                 C
Your story to remain untold
     G                C
Your love not to grow cold

        Em          C
All the promises we break
C        Em            C
From the cradle to the grave
     G     C       G
When all I want is you

You all I want is
You all I want is
You all I want is
You
