C           Bm      Em
I watch the clock a lot
C                Bm        Em
To see where I'm at in the plot

Its all so moving to me

C           Bm    Em
And I don't wanna leave

This walking dream

C         Bm
To get me home

Hair on my pillow

Like a weeping willow
G    C            G
Cool breeze blows through

Prima donna stuck in a trailer

Blasting Fonda for the news

In days of olden
G           C
Silence was golden

Cool breeze blows through
