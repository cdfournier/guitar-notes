G
Kitty Malone sat on a mule
G
Was riding in style
     C
When suddenly like the sound of a buzzard's breaking
C          A                 D
Kitty felt laser beams being fired at her head

G
She said I hate laser beams
G
And you never done see me asking
      C         A         D
For a UFO for a UFO for a UFO
In Tomahawk County

D
Well she kicked the mule
And it walked the path
And the aliens fired from behind
Til she stopped the mule
And she kicked the rump
And the big old mule took a big old dump

F          C               G
Scent of a mule you better watch out where you go
F         C           D
Take your laser beams away
F          C               G
Scent of a mule you better watch out where you go
F          C               A   D
You better stop that laser game
                   G
Or you'll smell my mule

G
She felt the fire against her neck
G
And it saddened her to feel it burn
     C
When suddenly like the sound of a breeding Holstein
C          A                         D
Kitty said stop we ain't looking for fighting
In Tomahawk County

D
A little guy from the UFO
Came on out and said his name was Joe
She said come on over for some lemonade
Just follow me now with the whole brigade

F          C               G
Scent of a mule you better watch out where you go
F         C           D
Take your laser beams away
F          C               G
Scent of a mule you better watch out where you go
F          C               A   D
You better stop that laser game

G
They walked into her cabin shack
G
They had never seen a southern home
C
And they liked it better than their UFO
C    A             D
They liked it they really liked it

D               C           F
They said here's a place of elegance
G       C                   F
Here we shower ourselves in lightness
D     C           F
Here's a place of elegance
G       C                   F
Here we shower ourselves in lightness
D     C           F
Here's a place of elegance
G       C                   F
Here we shower ourselves in lightness
D     C           F
Here's a place of elegance
G       C
Here we shower ourselves in

F          C               G
Scent of a mule you better watch out where you go
F         C           D
Take your laser beams away
F          C               G
Scent of a mule you better watch out where you go
F          C               A   D
You better stop that laser game

F          C               G
Scent of a mule you better watch out where you go
F         C           D
Take your laser beams away

F          C               A   D   G
You better stop that laser game
