Em                                    C
Oh I believe there's someone watching over you
        D                               Em
They're watching every single thing you say
Em                                        C
And when you die they'll set you down and take you through
       D
You'll realize one day

         G
That the grass is always greener on the other side
    D
The neighbor's got a new car that you wanna drive
         Em                                 C
And when time is running out you wanna stay alive
       D
We all live under the same sky
D
We all will live we all will die
D
There is no wrong there is no right
D                       Em
The circle only has one side
Em 
Side side

Em                                   C
We all try hard to live our lives in harmony
    D                       Em
For fear of falling swiftly overboard
Em                             C
But life is both a major and a minor key
     D
Just open up the chord

          G
Cause the grass is always greener on the other side
    D
The neighbor's got a new car that you wanna drive
         Em                                 C
And when time is running out you wanna stay alive
       D
We all live under the same sky
D
We all will live we all will die
D
There is no wrong there is no right
D                       Em
The circle only has one side
