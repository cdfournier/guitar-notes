D                             F#m
A restless eye across a weary room
D                                      E
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
    B                                             D
The music played and played as we whirled without end
E                   G
No hint no word her honor to defend

D                              F#m
I will I will she sighed to my request
F#m                     D
And then she tossed her mane
D                               E
While my resolve was put to the test

     B
Then drowned in desire our souls on fire
  D
I led the way to the funeral pyre
    E
And without a thought of the consequence
E
I gave in to my decadence

B                             D
One slip and down the hole we fall
   A                        F#m
It seems to take no time at all
  B
A momentary lapse of reason
     D
That binds a life for life
  A
A small regret you won’t forget
A        F#m
There’ll be no sleep in here tonight

D                                          F#m
Was it love or was it the idea of being in love
F#m           D
Or was it the hand of fate
D                              E
That seemed to fit just like a glove
    B                                         D
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
    E
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone


B                             D
One slip and down the hole we fall
   A                        F#m
It seems to take no time at all
  B
A momentary lapse of reason
     D
That binds a life for life
  A
A small regret you won’t forget
A        F#m
There’ll be no sleep in here tonight
