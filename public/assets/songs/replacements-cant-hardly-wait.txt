I'll write you a letter tomorrow
  D                    G
Tonight I can't hold a pen
D                                G
Someone's got a stamp that I can borrow
  D                               G
I promise not to blow the address again

A           Bm           D
Lights that flash in the evening
A         Bm           D
Through a crack in the drapes

D             G

Ain't you had enough of this stuff
D                                       G
Ashtray floors dirty clothes and filthy jokes

A          Bm       D
See you're high and lonesome
A       Bm      D
Try and try and try

A           Bm           D
Lights that flash in the evening
A         Bm          D
Through a hole in the drapes
A       Bm            F#m
I'll be home when I'm sleeping
A     Bm     D
I can hardly wait

        G           D
I can't wait hardly wait
D       G           D
I can't wait hardly wait

I can't wait hardly wait
