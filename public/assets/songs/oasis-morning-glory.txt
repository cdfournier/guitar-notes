Em                  D
All your dreams are made
Em                                           D
When you're chained to your mirror with your razor blade
Em                   D                  A  C
Today's the day that all the world will see

Em            D
Another sunny afternoon
Em                           D
Walking to the sound of your favorite tune
Em                           D                A   C
Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon

A                     C
Need a little time to wake up

You know you should so I guess you might as well

A                C
What's the story morning glory
