Em
A worried man with a worried mind
Am
No one in front of me and nothing behind
Am        Em                                 B
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne

Got white skin blood in my eyes

I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies

Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
C                                              B         
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose

Em
People are crazy and times are strange
Am
I'm locked in tight I'm out of range
  Em               B           Em
I used to care but things have changed

Em - Am - Em B - Em

This place ain't doing me any good

I'm in the wrong town I should be in Hollywood
Am         Em                                     B

Ain't no shortcuts gonna dress in drag
Am     Em                                B           Em

Lot of water under the bridge lot of other stuff too

Em
I've been walking forty miles of bad road

If the Bible is right the world will explode
Am        Em                                         B
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can
Em
Some things are too hot to touch

The human mind can only stand so much

You can't win with a losing hand

C                                        B       Em
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
C                                                      B
Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street

You can hurt someone and not even know it

The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
B         Em
Gonna get low down gonna fly high
Em      Am
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
