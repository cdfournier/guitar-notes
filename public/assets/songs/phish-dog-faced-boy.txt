C               G             Am
I can't spare a moment on the dog faced boy
F            G                   C
I won't lend another hand to the worm girl of Hanoi
E                               F
Don't deplete my oxygen for the guy who's turning blue
C                      G            C
But ask me and I'll do anything for you

C                                             G
Whenever I think of you it only makes me feel sad
G                                              C
Whenever I think of you the best friend I ever had
C        A#                 C
Before I gave it up all for nothing

C                 G
Well I lied and I cheated
G
And it made me feel bad
G
It made me feel guilty for not being true
G
All the months I spend trying for a way to explain
G                                             C
In the end all I could do was turn my head in shame

C                   E      G                       C
Whenever I think of you oh darlin it makes me feel sad
G
Cause you deserve better and once I was it
G                                          C
Somehow my good intentions just got up and git

F                  G             C
So I won't spare a moment on the dog faced boy
F            G                   C
I won't lend another hand to the worm girl of Hanoi
E                               F
Don't deplete my oxygen for the guy who's turning blue
C                      G            C
But ask me and I'll do anything for you
