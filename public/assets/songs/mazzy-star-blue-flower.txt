D                       G
Waiting for a sign from you
D                       G
Waiting for a signal to change
G        D                            G
Have you forgotten what your love can do
G           D  G
Is this the end

D                   G
Walking through the city
G              D                           G
Your boots are high-heeled and are shining bright
G           D                              G
The sun was sparkling on the shaft of your knife
G             D
Flower in the morning rain
G
Dying in my hand
G      D      G
Was it all in vain

E                 G
Superstar in your own private movie
D                     G
I wanted just a minor part
    D
But I'm no fool
  G
I know you're cool
  A
I never really wanted your heart

D               G
Your feet rough heat
D                          G
Nothing seems to bring you down
G             D              G
It's not that cool when I'm around
G             D
Flower in the morning rain
G
Dying in my hand
G      D      G
Was it all in vain

E                 G

But I'm no fool
