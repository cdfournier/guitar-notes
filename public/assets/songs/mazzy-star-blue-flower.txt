D                       G
Waiting for a sign from you
D                       G
Waiting for a signal to change
         D                            G
Have you forgotten what your love can do
G           D
Is this the end

D                   G
Walking through the city
G              D                           G
Your boots are high-heeled and are shining bright
G           D                              G
The sun was sparkling on the shaft of your knife
G             D
Flower in the morning rain
G
Dying in my hand
D          G  E
Was it all in vain

Superstar in your own private movie
I wanted just a minor part
But I'm no fool
I know you're cool
I never really wanted your heart

You're the keeper of the key
Nothing seems to bring you down
It's not that cool when I'm around
Flower in the morning rain
Dying in my hand
Was it all in vain

Superstar in your own bright movie
I wanted just a minor part
But I'm no fool
I know you're cool
I never really wanted your heart
