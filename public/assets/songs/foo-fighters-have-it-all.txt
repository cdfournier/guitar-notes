Am D C

Am                               D C
You're my size I need to try you on
Am                               D C
Someone in between the right and wrong
Am                                     D C
Through everything you kept your wings apart
Am                                          D C
Through everything you stayed that same old heart
C        A
And when I've had enough

    A                  D
She drains me when I'm empty
    A                 D
She fills herself she takes it all
G      F#m        F             A
In too deep she's spilling over me
G      F#m        F             A
In too deep she's spilling over me
C                 Am
Go on and have it all

Am D C - Am D C

Am                                    D C
Running through this maze you hold me in
Am                                   D C
Searching all these days to find the end
Am                                      D C
You're everything you're everything I'm not
Am                              D C
But I'm anything I'm anyone you want
C        A
And when I've had enough

    A                  D
She drains me when I'm empty
    A                 D
She fills herself she takes it all
G      F#m        F             A
In too deep she's spilling over me
G      F#m        F             A
In too deep she's spilling over me
C                 Am
Go on and have it all
C       Am
Have it all
C       Am
Have it all
