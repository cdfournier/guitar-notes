A                     G
Early one morning the sun was shining
A               G
I was laying in bed
A                  G
Wondering if she'd changed at all
G      D
If her hair was still red
A                       G
Her folks they said our lives together
A                 G
Sure was gonna be rough
A                          G
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
G      D
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
E                         F#m
And I was standing on the side of the road
A                  D
Rain falling on my shoes
E                   F#m
Heading out for the East Coast
     A                    D            E
Lord knows I've paid some dues getting through
G       D     A
Tangled up in blue

A                    G
She was married when we first met
A          G
Soon to be divorced
A                     G
I helped her out of a jam I guess
G     D
But I used a little too much force
A                    G
We drove that car as far as we could
A                G
Abandoned it out West
A                      G
Split up on a dark sad night
G    D
Both agreeing it was best
E                    F#m
She turned around to look at me
A                D
As I was walking away
E                       F#m
I heard her say over my shoulder
      A              D          E
We'll meet again someday on the avenue
G       D     A
Tangled up in blue

A                  G
I had a job in the great north woods
A                       G
Working as a cook for a spell
A                       G
But I never did like it all that much
G       D
And one day the ax just fell
A                    G
So I drifted down to New Orleans
A                      G
Where I happened to be employed
A                        G
Working for a while on a fishing boat
G     D
Right outside of Delacroix
E                       F#m
But all the while I was alone
A                  D
The past was close behind
E               F#m
I seen a lot of women
        A                D               E
But she never escaped my mind and I just grew
G       D     A
Tangled up in blue

A                    G
She was working in a topless place
A                      G
And I stopped in for a beer
A                          G
I just kept looking at the side of her face
G      D
In the spotlight so clear
A                   G
And later on as the crowd thinned out
A                        G
I's just about to do the same
A                         G
She was standing there in back of my chair
A          D
Said to me don't I know your name
E                         F#m
I muttered something underneath my breath
A               D
She studied the lines on my face
E                            F#m
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
         A                    D           E
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
G       D     A
Tangled up in blue

A                       G
She lit a burner on the stove
A                G
And offered me a pipe
A                         G
I thought you'd never say hello she said
A                 D
You look like the silent type
A                            G
Then she opened up a book of poems
A                G
And handed it to me
A                     G
Written by an Italian poet
G        D
From the thirteenth century
E                     F#m
And every one of them words rang true
A               D
And glowed like burning coal
E                    F#m
Pouring off of every page
            A             D               E
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
G       D     A
Tangled up in blue

A                    G
I lived with them on Montague Street
A                      G
In a basement down the stairs
A                      G
There was music in the cafes at night
G       D
And revolution in the air
A                    G
Then he started into dealing with slaves
A                           G
And something inside of him died
A                    G
She had to sell everything she owned
G   D
And froze up inside
E                    F#m
And when finally the bottom fell out
A            D
I became withdrawn
E                            F#m
The only thing I knew how to do
       A                  D                E
Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew
G       D     A
Tangled up in blue

A                     G
So now I'm going back again
A                       G
I got to get to her somehow
A                         G
All the people we used to know
A          D
They're an illusion to me now
A               G
Some are mathematicians
A                    G
Some are carpenters' wives
A                     G
Don't know how it all got started
G       D
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
E                       F#m
But me I'm still on the road
A                   D
Heading for another joint
E                      F#m
We always did feel the same
        A             D                  E
We just saw it from a different point of view
G       D     A
Tangled up in blue
