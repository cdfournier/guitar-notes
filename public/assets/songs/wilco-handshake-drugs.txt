I was chewing gum for something to do
    G                        F
The blinds were being pulled down on the dew

Inside out of love what a laugh
D                 G  F
I was looking for you

Saxophones started blowing me down
      G               F                        D
I was buried in sound taxicabs were driving me around
D      G                 F              D
To the handshake drugs I bought downtown

Exactly what you want me to be
