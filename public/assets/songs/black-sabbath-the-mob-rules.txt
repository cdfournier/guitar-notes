Am  D G - Am  D G

Am
Close the city and tell the people that
Am                    D  G
Something's coming to call
Am
Death and darkness are rushing forward to
Am                   D  G   E
Take a bite from the wall oh

E
You've nothing to say they're breaking away
D                              Am   D  G
If you listen to fools the mob rules
G       Am   D  G
The mob rules

Am
Kill the spirit and you'll be blinded
Am                    D  G
The end is always the same
Am
Play with fire you burn your fingers and
Am                    D  G  E
Lose your hold of the flame oh

E
It's over it's done the end is begun
D                              Am   D  G
If you listen to fools the mob rules

Am  D G - Am  D G E

E
You've nothing to say oh they're breaking away
D                     Am   D  G
If you listen to fools

Am
Break the circle and stop the movement
Am                         D  G
The wheel is thrown to the ground
Am
Just remember it might start rolling and
Am                  D  G
Take you right back around

Am  D G - Am  D G

G          Am   D  G
You're all fools
G       Am   D  G
The mob rules
