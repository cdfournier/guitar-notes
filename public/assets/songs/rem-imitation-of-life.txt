Em           Am
Charades pop skill
Am    G       D
Water hyacinth
D          Em
Named by a poet
Am           G   D C
Imitation of life

Em     Am       G
Like a koi in a frozen pond
D                    Em
Like a goldfish in a bowl
Am              G
I don't want to hear you cry

     G               Em
That sugar cane that tasted good
     Am              C    D
That cinnamon that's Hollywood
G
Come on come on
Em                 Am  C D
No-one can see you try

You want the greatest thing
The greatest thing since bread came sliced
You've got it all
You've got it sized

Like a Friday fashion show
Teenager cruising in the corner
Trying to look like you don't try

That sugar cane that tasted good
That cinnamon that's Hollywood
Come on come on
No-one can see you try

No-one can see you cry

That sugar cane that tasted good
That' freezing rain that's what you could
Come on come on
No-one can see you cry

This sugar cane this lemonade
This hurricane I'm not afraid
Come on come on
No-one can see me cry

This lightning storm this tidal wave
This avalanche I'm not afraid
Come on come on
No-one can see me cry

That sugar cane that tasted good
That's who you are that's what you could
Come on come on
No-one can see you cry

That sugar cane that tasted good
That's who you are that's what you could
Come on come on
No-one can see you cry
