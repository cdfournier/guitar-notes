I took a walk down a road
D        C                   G    C G
It's the road I was meant to stay
G         Em
I see the fire in your eyes
Em          C               G   C G
But a man's got to make his way

G          C                   G
So are you tough enough for my love
G               Em                 C
Just close your eyes to the heaven above
C                          G   C G
I'm coming home I'm coming home

G        D
I took a ride in a world
D       C                           G    C G
I'll be spinning for the rest of my life
G           Em
I feel your heart beating baby
Em      C                    G   C G
Ooh sometimes it cuts like a knife

G          C                   G
So are you tough enough for my love
G               Em                 C
Just close your eyes to the heaven above
C                          G   C G
I'm coming home I'm coming home

G          Em
I'm coming home
Em              C                    G  C G
Where your love tonight can shine on me
G          Am
I'm coming home
Am                C               D
Where your loving arms can set me free
