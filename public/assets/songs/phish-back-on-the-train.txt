When I jumped off I had a bucket full of thoughts
E                                                A   G
When I first jumped off I held that bucket in my hand
E
Ideas that would take me all around the world
A                                        G
I stood and watched the smoke behind the mountain curl
D                         A               E
It took me a long time to get back on the train

E
Now I'm gone and I'll never look back again
E                                    A  G
I'm gone and I'll never look back at all
E
You know I'll never look back again
A                       G
I turn my face into the howling wind
D                         A               E
It took me a long time to get back on the train

E
See my face in the town that's flashing by
E                                     A   G
See me standing at the station in the rain
E
See me running there beside the car
A                               G
I left it all behind again I'll travel far
D                         A               E
It took me a long time to get back on the train
