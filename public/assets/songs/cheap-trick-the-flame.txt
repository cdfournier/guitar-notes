Another night slowly closes in
G      A
And it feels so lonely
G
Touching heat freezing on my skin
  A
I pretend you still hold me

Bm                  G
I'm going crazy I'm losing sleep
Bm                    G                 D
I'm in too far I'm in way too deep over you
  A                    G
I can't believe you're gone
A            G            A      G
You were the first you'll be the last

D            A               G
Wherever you go I'll be with you
D            A                    G
Whatever you want I'll give it to you
D            A
Whenever you need someone
   D                  G
To lay your heart and head upon
G                  D
Remember after the fire after all the rain
G             C                   G
I will be the flame I will be the flame

G
Watching shadows move across the wall
A
Feels so frightening
G
I wanna run to you I wanna call
    A
But I've been hit by lightning

Bm                      G
Just can't stand up for falling apart
Bm
Can't see through this veil
G                    D
Across my heart over you
A                    G
You'll always be the one
A            G            A      G
You were the first you'll be the last

D            A               G
Wherever you go I'll be with you
D            A                    G
Whatever you want I'll give it to you
D            A
Whenever you need someone
   D                  G
To lay your heart and head upon
G                  D
Remember after the fire after all the rain
G             C                   G
I will be the flame I will be the flame
