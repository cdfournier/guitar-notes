Everyone I know is lonely
A   C
And God's so far away
C      A
And my heart belongs to no one
A  C
So now sometimes I pray

A
Take the space between us
C
And fill it up some way
D
Take the space between us
A
And fill it up fill it up

A
O my God you take the biscuit
C
Treating me this way
A
Expecting me to treat you well
   C
No matter what you say

C   A
How can I turn the other cheek
A    C
It's black and bruised and torn
C         D
I've been waiting
D                        A
Since the day that I was born
A
Fill it up fill it up fill it up

The fat man in his garden
C
The thin man at his gate

My God you must be sleeping
A    C
Wake up it's much too late

A
Take the space between us
C
And fill it up some way
D
Take the space between us
A
And fill it up fill it up fill it up

Do I have to tell the story
D        A          D
Of a thousand rainy days
D              A      D    A    D
Since we first met
D      A            D
It's a big enough umbrella
D        A              D               A
But it's always me that ends up getting wet
