Am             G                  F
Slide away and give it all you've got
Am       G                F
My today fell in from the top
Am                 G                  F
I dream of you and all the things you say
Am                        G F
I wonder where you are now

Am           G               F
Hold me down all the world's asleep
Am                    G                 F
I need you now you've knocked me off my feet
Am                    G               F
I dream of you and we talk of growing old
Am                       G F
But you said please don't

G        F    G              F
Slide in baby together we'll fly
G          F
I've tried praying
F           G
But I don't know just what you're saying to me

G               C
Now that you're mine
C            G
We'll find a way
G              F
Of chasing the sun
F             Am                  G
Let me be the one who shines with you
G      D                             F
In the morning we don't know what to do

F        C
Two of a kind
C            G
We'll find a way
G                F
To do what we've done
F             Am                  G
Let me be the one who shines with you
G                F   D
And we can slide away
      F   D
Slide away
      F   D
Slide away
G   E
Away
