E D

E                                     D
Appendages flailing you're running at me
E                                D
Ferocious tenaciously clawing at me
E                              D
The devious gelatin holding me fast
E                              D
Miraculous now you let me ooze past

E                               D
Over the wall rushing rivers of sleaze
E                                  D
The tip of stalactites incising my knees
E                                  D
A slipper a sand dollar day at the shore
E                                      D
Nice evening at home that I dread even more

D         A                    D
Would you please make clear to me
    A                   E    A
I'm peering out through your opacity
A                              D
Though you rehearse tomorrow's verse
A               E                  A
Forgive me if I don't sing in your key

E                                     D
Back on those days when my life was a haze
E                              D
The gelatin lay on a truncated sleigh
E                                   D
Copernicus drank from a vessel that stank
E                                           D
From the free mason's crank to the overflow tank

E                                D
Bane of the weasel for biting is fun
E                                     D
Jump on the turnstile and watch me go round
E                                       D
Swim with the cactus and float with the stone
E                                  D
I try to convey what you strive to condone

D         A                    D
Would you please make clear to me
    A                   E    A
I'm peering out through your opacity
A                              D
Though you rehearse tomorrow's verse
A               A                  A
Forgive me if I don't sing in your key
A

Would you please (no left turn un-stoned)
A             D
Make clear to me (when you see me)
    A              E                  A
Why nothing is the first thing that I see

And if you do (no left turn un-stoned)
A         D
And I see you (when you see me)
A                    E                A
Then you will be the nothing left for me
