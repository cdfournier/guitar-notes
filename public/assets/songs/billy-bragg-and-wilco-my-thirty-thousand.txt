     G
Paul Robeson he's the man
     C
That faced the Ku Klux Klan
   G
On hollow grove's golfing ground
G                   D
His words come sounding

    G
And all around him there
   C
To jump and clap and cheer
  G                        D
I sent the best the best I had
D         G
My thirty thousand

G
The Klansman leader said
     C
That Paul would lose his head
     G
When thirty five thousand vets
G             D
Broke up that concert

    G
But less than four thousand came
   C
To side with the Klan
    G                      D
But around Paul's lonesome oak
D         G
My thirty thousand

  C
A beersoaked brassy band
    G
Did snortle around the grounds
G
Four hundred noblest souls
G             D
Westchester's manhood

     G
They looked exactly like
      C
Fleas on a tiger's back
     G                  D
Lost fish in the waters of
D         G
My thirty thousand

     G
When Paul had sung and gone
        C
And the kids and babies home
     G
Cops came with guns and clubs
G               D
And clubbed and beat them

    G
I'd hate to be a cop
       C
Caught with a bloody stick
      G                         D
Cause you can't bash the brains out
D         G
Of thirty thousand

     G
Each eye you tried to gouge
     C
Each skull you tried to crack
      G
Has a thousand thousand friends
G           D
Around this green grass

D      G
If you furnish the skull someday
     C
I'll pass out the clubs and guns
C      G                  D
To the billion hands that love
D         G
My thirty thousand

     C
Each wrinkle on your face
  G
I know it at a glance
G
You cannot run and hide
G            D
Nor duck nor dodge them

D        G
And your carcass and your deeds
     C
Will fertilize the seeds
C      G                 D
Of the men that stood to guard
D         G
My thirty thousand
G                        D
Of the men that stood to guard
D         G
My thirty thousand
