G
Paul Robeson he's the man
C
That faced the Ku Klux Klan
G
On hollow grove's golfing ground
G                   D
His words come sounding

G
And all around him there
C
To jump and clap and cheer
G               D
I sent the best the best I had
   G
My thirty thousand

G
The Klansman leader said
C
That Paul would lose his head
G
When thirty five thousand vets
D
Broke up that concert

G
But less than four thousand came
C
To side with the Klan
G                 D
But around Paul's lonesome oak
   G
My thirty thousand

C
A beersoaked brassy band
G
Did snortle around the grounds
G
Four hundred noblest souls
D
Westchester's manhood

G
They looked exactly like
C
Fleas on a tiger's back
G                D
Lost fish in the waters of
   G
My thirty thousand

G
When Paul had sung and gone
C
And the kids and babies home
G
Cops came with guns and clubs
D
And clubbed and beat them

G
I'd hate to be a cop
C
Caught with a bloody stick
G               D
Cause you can't bash the brains out
   G
Of thirty thousand

G
Each eye you tried to gouge
C
Each skull you tried to crack
G
Has a thousand thousand friends
D
Around this green grass

G
If you furnish the skull someday
C
I'll pass out the clubs and guns
G              D
To the billion hands that love
   G
My thirty thousand

C
Each wrinkle on your face
G
I know it at a glance
G
You cannot run and hide
D
Nor duck nor dodge them

G
And your carcass and your deeds
C
Will fertilize the seeds
G               D
Of the men that stood to guard
   G
My thirty thousand
G               D
Of the men that stood to guard
   G
My thirty thousand
