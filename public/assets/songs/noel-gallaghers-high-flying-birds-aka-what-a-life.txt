Am
Someday you might find your hero
Am
Some say you might lose your mind
Am
I'm keeping my head down now for the summer
Am
I'm out of my mind but pour me another
Am
I'm gonna take that tiger outside for a ride

Am     F D Am
What a life
Am     F D Am
What a life

Am
Keep on chasing down that rainbow
Am
You'll never know what you might find
Am
Over the sunset on the horizon
Am
It may be a dream but it tastes like poison
Am
I'm gonna take that tiger outside for a ride

Am     F D Am
What a life
Am     F D Am
What a life
Am     F D Am
What a life
Am     F D Am
What a life

Am     F D Am
What a life
Am     F D Am
What a life
Am     F D Am
What a life
Am     F D Am
What a life

Am
Someday you might find your hero
Am
Some say you might lose your mind
