By your leave I think that I'll be going now
C                            A
I think I've stayed a little long
C                           G
I looked up all my mother's recipes
C                        A
I can't think what I did wrong

G          D          G                  D
We go to a restaurant but you don't like wine
G            D             G               D
You say it's love you want but there is no time

C    D          C              D
I realize I can see it in your eyes
C        D              G
You keep staring at the floor

C                             G
I used to look at your school photographs
C                     A
But I don't have them anymore
C                        G
I wonder who's in my old college rooms
C                         A
Or stuck on my old locker door

G              D            G    D
I dream of the ships at sea on a stormy night
G           D         G             D
I wish that it was me but I wake in fright

C    D          C              D
I realize I can see it in your eyes
C         D             G
I've only got myself to blame

C                       G
Winter kisses when your lips were blue
C                              A
Like chasing wild geese in the snow
C                     G
Pressing faces on the window panes
C                           A
But that's a long long time ago

G          D         G D
We go to a restaurant
G            D            G D
You say it's love you want

C    D          C              D
I realize I can see it in your eyes
C             D               G
You're moving on to something more
