D               E
Well she was an American girl
G         A
Raised on promises
D                 E
She couldn't help thinking
E                G                   A
That there was a little more to life somewhere else

A                  D
After all it was a great big world
G                      Em
With lots of places to run to
A
And if she had to die trying
A
She had one little promise she was gonna keep

G       A
Oh yeah all right
D
Take it easy baby
Bm
Make it last all night
G       A           D
She was an American girl

D                   E
Well it was kind of cold that night
G                      A
She stood alone on her balcony
D                       E
Yeah she could hear the cars roll by
       G              A
Out on 441 like waves crashing on the beach

A                     D
And for one desperate moment there
G                    Em
He crept back in her memory
A
God it's so painful when something that's so close
A
Is still so far out of reach

G       A
Oh yeah all right
D
Take it easy baby
Bm
Make it last all night
G       A           D
She was an American girl

D E G A - D E G A

G       A
Oh yeah all right
D
Take it easy baby
Bm
Make it last all night
G       A           D
She was an American girl

G       A
Oh yeah all right
D
Take it easy baby
Bm
Make it last all night
G       A           D
She was an American girl
