Bm
Just as you take my hand
Bm
Just as you write my number down
Bm
Just as the drinks arrive
Bm                                 G
Just as they play your favorite song
G                        F#m        
As your bad day disappears
F#m                            Em
No longer wound up like a spring
Em                    A
Before you had too much
A                       Bm
Come back in focus again

Bm
The walls are bending shape
Bm
They've got a Cheshire cat grin
Bm
All blurring into one
Bm                        G
This place is on a mission
G                  F#m
Before the night owl
F#m                    Em
Before the animal noises
Em                   A
Closed circuit cameras
A                     Bm
Before you're comatose

Bm
Before you run away from me
Bm
Before you're lost between the notes
Bm
The beat goes round and round
Bm                          G
The beat goes round and round
G                      F#m
I never really got there
F#m                       Em
I just pretended that I had
Em                        A
Words are blunt instruments
A                           Bm
Words are sawed-off shotguns

Bm
Come on and let it out
Bm
Come on and let it out
Bm
Come on and let it out
Bm                   G
Come on and let it out
G                         F#m
Before you run away from me
F#m                                Em
Before you're lost between the notes
Em                     A
Just as you take the mic
A                       Bm
Just as you dance dance dance

Bm
Jigsaw falling into place
Bm
So there is nothing to explain
    A#m
You eye each other as you pass
D
She looks back you look back
G        F#
Not just once
G        F#
Not just twice

Bm
Wish away the nightmare
Bm
Wish away the nightmare
Bm           A#m
You've got a light you can feel it on your back
  D
A light you can feel it on your back
G      F#      G    F#
Jigsaw falling into place
