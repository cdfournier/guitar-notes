Bm
Just as you take my hand
Bm
Just as you write my number down
Bm
Just as the drinks arrive
Bm
Just as they play your favorite song
G
As your bad day disappears
F#m
No longer wound up like a spring
Em
Before you had too much
A                       Bm
Come back in focus again

Bm
The walls are bending shape
Bm
They've got a Cheshire cat grin
Bm
All blurring into one
Bm
This place is on a mission
G
Before the night owl
F#m
Before the animal noises
Em
Closed circuit cameras
A                     Bm
Before you're comatose

Bm
Before you run away from me
Bm
Before you're lost between the notes
Bm
The beat goes round and round
Bm
The beat goes round and round
G
I never really got there
F#m
I just pretended that I had
Em
Words are blunt instruments
A                           Bm
Words are sawed-off shotguns

Bm
Come on and let it out
Bm
Come on and let it out
Bm
Come on and let it out
Bm
Come on and let it out
G
Before you run away from me
F#m
Before you're lost between the notes
Em
Just as you take the mic
A                       Bm
Just as you dance dance dance

So there is nothing to explain
    A#m
You eye each other as you pass
D
She looks back you look back
G        F#
Not just once
G        F#
Not just twice

Bm
Wish away the nightmare

Wish away the nightmare

You've got a light you can feel it on your back

A light you can feel it on your back
