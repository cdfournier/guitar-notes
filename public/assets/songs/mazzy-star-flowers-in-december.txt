G        Em          C     D
Before I let you down again
G              Em      C       D
I just want to see you in your eyes
G               Em         C         Am
I wouldn't have taken everything out on you
G      Em          C          D
I only thought you could understand

G        Em             C            D
They say every man goes blind in his heart
G            Em        C                 D
And they say everybody steals somebody's heart away
G            Em              C   Am
And I've got nothing more to say about it
G       Em            C       D
Nothing more than you would me

C               G       D            G
Send me your flowers of your December
C               G       D            G
Send me your dreams of your candy wine
C          G         D            G
I got just one thing I can't give you
C    G                 D
Just one more thing of mine

G        Em             C            D
They say every man goes blind in his heart
G        Em        C                 D
They say everybody steals somebody's heart away
G             Em                C      Am
And I've been wondering why you let me down
G          Em        C       D
And I been taking it all for granted
