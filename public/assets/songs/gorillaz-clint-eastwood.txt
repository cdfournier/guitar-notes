The essence the basics without it you naked
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm you have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them every sprouting tree every child of peace
Every cloud and sea you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise corruption in disguise (That's right)
From this fucking enterprise now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide y'all can see me now
Cause you don't see with your eye you perceive with your mind
That's the inner (Fuck em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)
Feelings sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head


I ain't happy I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on it's coming on
It's coming on it's coming on


My future is coming on
It's coming on it's coming on
It's coming on it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on it's coming on
It's coming on it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on it's coming on
My future
