D                     G
The lunatic is on the grass
D                     G
The lunatic is on the grass
D                     E
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
G               A              D
Got to keep the loonies on the path

D                     G
The lunatic is in the hall
D                      G
The lunatics are in my hall
D                            E
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
G                 A                D
And every day the paper boy brings more

G                          A
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
    C                            G
And if there is no room upon the hill
G                              A
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
     C                               G
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

D                    G
The lunatic is in my head
D                    G
The lunatic is in my head
D                  E
You raise the blade you make the change
G        A               D
You rearrange me til I'm sane
D                E
You lock the door and throw away the key
G                     A                 D
There's someone in my head but it's not me

G                       A
And if the cloud bursts thunder in your ear
C                             G
You shout and no one seems to hear
G                                A
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
     C                               G
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

All that you touch and all that you see
Bm                A
All that you taste all you feel
    D
And all that you love and all that you hate
Bm              A
All you distrust all you save
    D
And all that you give and all that you deal
    Bm                   A
And all that you buy beg borrow or steal
    D
And all you create and all you destroy
    Bm                  A
And all that you do and all that you say
    D
And all that you eat and everyone you meet
    Bm                      A
And all that you slight and everyone you fight
    D
And all that is now and all that is gone
    Bm                     A
And all that's to come and everything
A         D
Under the sun is in tune
D                              Bm   D
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon
