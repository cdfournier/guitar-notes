D                     G
The lunatic is on the grass
D                     G
The lunatic is on the grass
D                     E
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
G               A              D
Got to keep the loonies on the path

D                     G
The lunatic is in the hall
D                      G
The lunatics are in my hall
D                            E
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
G                 A                D
And every day the paper boy brings more

G                          A
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
    C                            G
And if there is no room upon the hill
G                              A
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
     C                               G
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

D                    G
The lunatic is in my head
D                    G
The lunatic is in my head
D                  E
You raise the blade you make the change
G        A               D
You rearrange me til I'm sane
D                E
You lock the door and throw away the key
G                     A                 D
There's someone in my head but it's not me

G                       A
And if the cloud bursts thunder in your ear
C                             G
You shout and no one seems to hear
G                                A
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
     C                               G
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

All that you touch and all that you see

All that you taste all you feel

And all that you love and all that you hate

All you distrust all you save

And all that you give and all that you deal

And all that you buy beg borrow or steal

And all you create and all you destroy

And all that you do and all that you say

And all that you eat and everyone you meet

And all that you slight and everyone you fight

And all that is now and all that is gone

And all that's to come and everything under the sun is in tune

But the sun is eclipsed by the moon
