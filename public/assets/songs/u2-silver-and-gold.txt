In the shithouse a shotgun
E
Praying hands hold me down
E
If only the hunter was hunted
E
In this tin can town tin can town
E
No stars in the black night
E
Looks like the sky fall down
E
No sun in the daylight
E
Looks like it's chained to the ground chained to the ground

The warden says the exodus sold
A      B             A
If you want a way out
           E    A          E
Silver and gold silver and gold

A E A E A

E                  A
Broken back to the ceiling
E                  A
Broken nose to the floor
E               A
I scream at the silence
A             E                A
It's crawling crawls under the door
E                        A
There's a rope around my neck
E                             A
And there's a trigger in your gun
E         A
Jesus say something
E        A            E   A          E
I am someone I am someone   I am someone

E                  A
Captains and Kings in the ship's hold
A    B             A
They came to collect
           E    A          E    A
Silver and gold silver and gold

Em                        A
I seen the coming and the going
Em                        A
Seen the captains and the Kings
Em                      A
Seen their navy blue uniforms
A         Em                      A                E
Seen them bright and shiny things bright and shiny things

The temperature is rising
E               A
The fever white hot
E                  A
Mister I ain't got nothing
A        E                A
But it's more than you've got
E                      A
These chains no longer bind me
E                      A
Nor the shackles at my feet
E                  A
Outside are the prisoners
E          A             E
Inside the free set them free

E                    A
A prize fighter in a corner is told
B                 A               E
Hit where it hurts for silver and gold
A          E
Silver and gold
