A                Em       D
I am an American aquarium drinker
A          Em       D
I assassin down the avenue
A                     Em       D
I'm hiding out in the big city blinking
A                          Em        D
What was I thinking when I let go of you

A Em D - A Em D

A                      Em          D
Let's forget about the tongue-tied lightning
A                       Em         D
Let's undress just like cross-eyed strangers
A                     Em          D
This is not a joke so please stop smiling
A                          Em             D
What was I thinking when I said it didn't hurt

A Em D - A Em D

A                             Em         D
I want to glide through these brown eyes gleaming
A                    Em           D
Deep from the inside baby hold on tight
A                          Em            D
You were so right when you said I'd been drinking
A                           Em       D
What was I thinking when we said goodnight

A Em D - A Em D

A                         Em          D
I want to hold you in the bible-black pre-dawn
A                           Em      D
You're quite a quiet domino bury me now
A                              Em               D
Take off your band-aid cause I don't believe in touchdowns
A                           Em   D
What was I thinking when we said hello

A Em D

A                          Em       D
I always thought that if I held you tightly
A                             Em       D
You'd always love me like you did back then
A                          Em        D
Then I fell asleep and the city kept blinking
A                          Em           D
What was I thinking when I let you back in

A              Em         D
I am trying to break your heart
A              Em         D
I am trying to break your heart
A                Em                        D
And still I'd be lying if I said it wasn't easy
A              Em         D
I am trying to break your heart

A                   Em        D
I assassin down the avenue
A                     Em       D
I'm hiding out in the big city blinking
A                          Em        D
What was I thinking when I let go of you

A Em D

I'm the man who loves you
