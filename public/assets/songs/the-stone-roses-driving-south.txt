Driving south round midnight
D
Man I must have been insane
G
Driving south round midnight
G                     D
In a howling hurricane

A
I stopped for an old man hitcher
A    G
At a lonely old crossroad
   A
He said I'm going nowhere
A       G
And I'm only here to see
G        D
If I can steal your soul

D
I'm not trying to make you
D
I don't want to touch your skin
G
I know all there is to know
G                          D
About you and all your sins

A
Well you ain't too young or pretty
A       G
And you sure as hell can't sing
A
Any time you want to sell your soul
G
I've got a toll-free number
G       D
You can ring (yeah that's what I thought he said anyway)

Oh eight oh oh triple-six oh yeah
