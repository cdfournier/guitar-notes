Em G Em G Am

Em
Good and bad
  G                   Em           G
I swear I've had them both they're overrated
G         F
But is it fun
F            Am
When you get hold of one

Em                G
Some gone bad and some gone back
Em                G
Good ones all get taken
G                F
I'm calling your bluff
F                Am
You ain't strong enough

A#                   G
Wait and pray you'll pick on me
    A#             G
The day I raise my hand
A#                   G                   C
Guess that I've been blessed but I'll be damned

Em                    G
Say your prayers when you get scared
Em                G
Pray you're gonna make it
G                    F
And then when you're done
F        Am
You keep fucking up

Em                G
One day soon I'll disappear
    Em                  G
And if you'll come I'll take you
G            F
Somewhere to go
F            Am
To keep from growing old

A#                   G
Wait and pray you'll pick on me
    A#             G
The day I raise my hand

Oh oh whoa
D
Disappear the light is fading
C         D
Disappear outside their rage
D
Disappear I'm tired of waiting
D         F
Disappear before we get away
