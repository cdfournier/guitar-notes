A D A - A D A - A F#m D - A D A

A      D             A
All my daydreams are disasters
A         D           A
She's the one think I love
A      F#m           D
Rivers burn then run backwards
    A   D        A
For her   that's enough

A        D                  A
They all come from New York City
A    D             A
They woke me up at dawn
A               F#m       D
She walked with me to the fountain
    A    D         A
She held   onto my arm

A
Come on do what you did
D             Bm
Roll me under New Madrid
D                 A                E
Shake my baby and please bring her back
      A
Cause death won't even be still 
D               Bm
Caroms over the landfill
D             E             A
Buries us all in its broken back

A         D      A
There's a man of conviction
A     D                   A
And although he's getting old
A       F#m        D
Mr. Browning has a prediction
    A     D          A
And we've   all been told

A          D                  A
So come on back from New York City
A         D            A
Roll your trucks in at dawn
A         F#m       D
Walk with me to the fountain
    A    D         A
And hold   onto my arm

A
Come on do what you did
D             Bm
Roll me under New Madrid
D                 A                E
Shake my baby and please bring her back
      A
Cause death won't even be still 
D               Bm
Caroms over the landfill
D             E             A
Buries us all in its broken back
