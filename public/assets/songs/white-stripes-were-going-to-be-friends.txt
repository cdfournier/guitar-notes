Brand new shoes walking blues

Walk with me Suzy Lee
G
Through the park and by the tree
C
We will rest upon the ground
G
And look at all the bugs we found
D              C                G
Safely walk to school without a sound
D              C                G
Safely walk to school without a sound

G
Here we are no one else

We walk to school all by ourselves
C
There's dirt on our uniforms
G
From chasing all the ants and worms
D               C                G
We clean up and now it's time to learn
D               C                G
We clean up and now it's time to learn

Numbers letters learn to spell
G
Nouns and books and show and tell
C
Playtime we will throw the ball
G
Back to class through the hall
D                 C                  G
Teacher marks our height against the wall
D                 C                  G
Teacher marks our height against the wall

C                         G

  We don't notice anything
A
We sit side by side in every class
C
Teacher thinks that I sound funny

But she likes the way you sing

G
Tonight I'll dream while I'm in bed
G
When silly thoughts go through my head
C
About the bugs and alphabet
G
And when I wake tomorrow I'll bet
     D              C             G
That you and I will walk together again
D               C               G
