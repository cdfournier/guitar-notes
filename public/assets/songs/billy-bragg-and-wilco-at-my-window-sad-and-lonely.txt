A - F#m D A

A
At my window sad and lonely
F#m           D         A
Oft times do I think of thee
A
Sad and lonely and I wonder
F#m        D         A
Do you ever think of me

A     F#m            A
Every day is sad and lonely
    F#m                    A
And every night is sad and blue
A
Do you ever think of me my darling
F#m      D               A
  As you sail that ocean blue

A
At my window sad and lonely
F#m           D         A
Oft times do I think of thee
A
Sad and lonely and I wonder
F#m        D         A
Do you ever think of me

A        F#m          A
Will you find another sweetheart
F#m                     A
In some far and distant land
A
Sad and lonely now I wonder
F#m        D          A
If our boat will ever land

A D A

A         F#m            A
Ships may ply the stormy oceans
F#m                           A
And planes may fly the stormy sky
A
I'm sad and lonely but remember
F#m          D       A
I'll love you till I die
