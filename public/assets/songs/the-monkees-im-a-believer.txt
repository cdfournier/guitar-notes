G                  D            G
I thought love was only true in fairy tales
G                 D                G
Meant for someone else but not for me
C                   G
Love was out to get me
C                 G
That's the way it seemed
C              G              D
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

               G  C     G       C
Then I saw her face now I'm a believer
C     G        C           G
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
C      G
I'm in love
C  G                         F              D
   I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I tried

G                  D              G
I thought love was more or less a giving thing
G                D               G
Seems the more I gave the less I got
C                 G
What's the use in trying
C              G
All you get is pain
C                G           D
When I needed sunshine I got rain

               G  C     G       C
Then I saw her face now I'm a believer
C     G        C           G
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
C      G
I'm in love
