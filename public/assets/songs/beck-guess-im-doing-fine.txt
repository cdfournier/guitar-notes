E A G#m

E         A              G#m
There's a bluebird at my window
E       A                 G#m
I can't hear the songs he sings
E       A         G#m
All the jewels in Heaven
E          A                G#m
They don't look the same to me

G      A                   G
I just wade the tides that turned
G     F#m                E
Til I learn to leave the past behind

G#m       A             E
It's only lies that I'm living
G#m       A              E
It's only tears that I'm crying
G#m       A            E    D
It's only you that I'm losing
A               E
Guess I'm doing fine

E       A               G#m
All the battlements are empty
E       A              G#m
And the moon is laying low
E      A            G#m
Yellow roses in the graveyard
E      A                  G#m
Got no time to watch them grow

G     A                G
Now I bade a friend farewell
G     F#m         E
I can do whatever pleases me

G#m       A             E
It's only lies that I'm living
G#m       A              E
It's only tears that I'm crying
G#m       A            E    D
It's only you that I'm losing
A               E
Guess I'm doing fine

A                       E
Press my face up to the window
A                     E
To see how warm it is inside
G#m                           A
See the things that I've been missing
F#m              E
Missing all this time

G#m       A             E
It's only lies that I'm living
G#m       A              E
It's only tears that I'm crying
G#m       A            E    D
It's only you that I'm losing
A               E
Guess I'm doing fine

A               E
Guess I'm doing fine
