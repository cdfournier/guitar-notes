C            D
Every time I think of you
D      Bm                        C
I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
C                                  D
It's no problem of mine but it's a problem I find
Bm                   C
Living a life that I can't leave behind

C                   D
There's no sense in telling me
D   Bm                       C
The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
C
But that's the way that it goes
C             D
And it's what nobody knows
D    Bm           C
Well every day my confusion grows

C            D
Every time I see you falling
  Bm             C
I get down on my knees and pray
    C                D
I'm waiting for that final moment
    Bm                 C
You say the words that I can't say

C                 D
I feel fine and I feel good
D   Bm             C
I'm feeling like I never should
C
Whenever I get this way 
C            D
I just don't know what to say
D            Bm                   C
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday

C                 D
I'm not sure what this could mean
  Bm                 C
I don't think you're what you seem
C                              D
I do admit to myself that if I hurt someone else
D         Bm                  C
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be

C            D
Every time I see you falling
  Bm             C
I get down on my knees and pray
    C                D
I'm waiting for that final moment
    Bm                 C
You say the words that I can't say

C            D
Every time I see you falling
  Bm             C
I get down on my knees and pray
    C                D
I'm waiting for that final moment
    Bm                 C
You say the words that I can't say
