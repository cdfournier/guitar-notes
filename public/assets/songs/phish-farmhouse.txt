C       G         Am
Welcome this is a farmhouse
Am       F            C
We have cluster-flies alas
G                C       G
And this time of year is bad

C      G       Am
We are so very sorry
Am       F             C       G
There is little we can do
G   C
But swat them

Am             G
She didn't beg or not enough
C                    F
She didn't stay when things got tough
C                G
I told a lie and she got mad
Am                    G          C
She wasn't there when things got bad

C                    G
I never ever saw the northern lights
Am                      F
I never really heard of cluster-flies
C                    G
I never ever saw the stars so bright
Am                           F
In the farmhouse things will be all right

C                    G

C                    G
I never ever saw the stars so bright
Am                           F
In the farmhouse things will be all right

Am                       G
Woke this morning to the stinging lash
C              F
Every man rise from the ash
C                         G
Each betrayal begins with trust
Am        G          C
Every man returns to dust

C                    G
I never ever saw the northern lights
