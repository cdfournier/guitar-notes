There's a cool breeze that blows wherever Cool Rick goes
C                            F
But he just got dead serious on me
D                  F
I startled him and made him sick
  G
I took the cool out of Cool Rick
    F                    C
And now he's Dead Serious Rick

C                             F
But if I needed you would you come to me
         C                    F
Put your head on my chest and help me rest
     D       F        G          C
Like Charlie now that you really know me

C                                   F
But it's not fair to compare you to Charlie man
   C                           F
In regard to the tenderness he gave me
     D                    F
It's easier for him to be near to me
   G                                 F
He doesn't understand anything about ethics
F                               C
And he's probably had extensive training

C                             F
But if I needed you would you come to me
         C                    F
Put your head on my chest and help me rest
     D       F        G          C
Like Charlie now that you really know me

    G             F              C
I'm sorry man I'm sorry I killed Cool Rick
