I don't want to be your friend
A                      E
I just want to be your lover
E
No matter how it ends
   A             E
No matter how it starts

E
Forget about your house of cards
A           E
And I'll do mine
E
Forget about your house of cards
A           E
And I'll do mine

    A
And fall off the table
A             E
And get swept under
F#m        A    E
    Denial denial

E
The infrastructure will collapse
     A       E
From voltage spikes
E
Throw your keys in the bowl
E         A       E
Kiss your husband goodnight

E
Forget about your house of cards
A           E
And I'll do mine
