F                              A#
If I keep holding out will the light shine through
F                                A#
Under this broken roof it's only rain that I feel
          F
I've been wishing out the days
A#    C       F
Oh oh oh come back

F                                 A#
I have been planning out all that I'd say to you
F                           A#
Since you slipped away know that I still remain true
F
I've been wishing out the days
C                  F
Please say that if you hadn't of gone now
                A#
I wouldn't have lost you another way
     F
From wherever you are
A#    C       F
Oh oh oh come back

A#      C                F
And the days they linger on
A#         C               F
And in the night I've been waiting for
C        A#                     F
The real possibility that I may meet you in my dreams
C       A#
I go to sleep

F                             A#
If I don't fall apart will my memory stay clear
F                      A#
So you had to go and I had to remain here
F
But the strangest thing to date
C                       F
So far away and yet you feel so close
                  A#
And I'm not gonna question it any other way
              F
There must be an open door
A#      C       F
For you to come back

A#      C                F
And the days they linger on
A#        C              F
And every night what I'm waiting for
C           A#                     F
Is the real possibility that I may meet you in my dreams
C                A#               F
Sometimes you're there and you're talking back to me
C        A#                    F
Come the morning I could swear you're next to me
C
And it's okay

F        A#
It's okay
F        A#
It's okay

F          A#
I need you come back come back
F          A#
I need you come back come back
F          A#
I need you come back come back
