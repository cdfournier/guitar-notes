A D G A - A D G A

        A               D
I never think about the future
D      G        A    A D G A
I just live for today
A                       D
And if you want a ready answer
D        G          A  A D G A
I've got nothing to say
A                      D
So please don't bother talking to me
D         G          A  A D G A
I'll just disappoint you
A                            D
Because I'm quite content to sit right here
D    G          A A D G A
With nothing to do

     E           A               D       E   E A D E
Well I'm not the singer that you used to know
  E              A                D        E E A D E
I used to be the guy that had someplace to go

E            A         D    G         A
But that was yesterday girl yesterday girl

A                     D
I never wanna find an answer cause
D       G        A    A D G A
I don't like the truth
A                           D
And if I find just what I'm looking for
D    G            A   A D G A
I've something to lose
A                             D
So please don't go and ask me questions
D      G              A
I just won't feel the same
A        D            G              A
(I'll do what you say doesn't matter anyway)
A                      D
And when I think about religion
D            G         A
Well there's no one to blame
A      D             G              A
