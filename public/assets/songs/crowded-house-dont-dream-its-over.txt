D Bm G - G F#

D
There is freedom within
Bm
There is freedom without
G                                  F#
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup

D
There's a battle ahead
Bm
Many battles are lost
G
But you'll never see the end of the road
G            F#
While you're traveling with me

G       A
Hey now hey now
A     D          Bm
Don't dream it's over
G       A
Hey now hey now
A        D           Bm
When the world comes in
G         A
They come they come
A  D            Bm
To build a wall between us
G                  A
We know they won't win

D
Now I'm towing my car
Bm
There's a hole in the roof
G
My possessions are causing me suspicion
G              F#
But there's no proof

D
In the paper today
Bm
Tales of war and of waste
G                                 F#
But you turn right over to the TV page

G       A
Hey now hey now
A     D          Bm
Don't dream it's over
G       A
Hey now hey now
A        D           Bm
When the world comes in
G          A
They come they come
A  D            Bm
To build a wall between us
G                  A
We know they won't win

D
Now I'm walking again
Bm
To the beat of a drum
G
And I'm counting the steps
G                   F#
To the door of your heart

D
Only shadows ahead
Bm
Barely clearing the roof
G                          F#
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

G       A
Hey now hey now
A     D          Bm
Don't dream it's over
G       A
Hey now hey now
A        D           Bm
When the world comes in
G         A
They come they come
A  D            Bm
To build a wall between us
G                   A
You know they won't win

A              G
Don't let them win
G        A        D Bm
(Hey now hey now)
G       A         D Bm
Hey now hey now
G       A         D Bm
Hey now hey now
G              A
Don't let them win
G          A          D Bm
