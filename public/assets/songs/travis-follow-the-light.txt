D      Em     C
Nobody really knows
D             Em          C
Where they're supposed to go
D      Em       C
Hiding behind a wall
D                   Em      C
Afraid that they'll lose it all

C        D     G
But it's alright
     D          G
Just follow the light
    D        G             C
And don't be afraid of the dark
       D       G        D              G
In the moonlight you'll dance till you fall
    D         G          C
And always be here in my heart

Cause nobody even cares

Everyone's on the make

And everyone's out for themselves
D          Em      C
I'm on the longest road
      D            Em     C
Where everything's overload
    D           Em        C
But I've got my heart and soul
   D              Em      C
So don't throw me overboard

Cause it's alright
     D          G
Just follow the light
    D        G             C
And don't be afraid of the dark
