Em               C          D              G
Somewhere in the distance I hear the bells ring
D                       C           Em
Darkness settles on the town as the children start to sing
        Em             C      D                 G
And the lady cross the street she shuts out the night
G         D                 C
There's a cast of thousands waiting
   Em
As she turns out the light

         Em      C D   G    D   C
But it's too late  too late too late
C            Em
Too late for love
Em      C D      G D        C   Em
Too late  too late too late too late

Em              C             D                G
London boys are gazing as the girls go hand in hand
D                     C               Em
With a pocket full of innocence their entrance is grand
        Em           C     D                  G
And the queen of the dream stands before them all
    D                 C
She stretches out her hand
C      Em
As the curtains start to fall

         Em      C D   G    D   C
But it's too late  too late too late
C            Em
Too late for love
Em      C D      G D        C   Em
Too late  too late too late too late

Em              C        D               G
Standing by the trapdoor aware of me and you
D                 C             Em
The actor and the clown they're waiting for their cue
              Em        C           D             G
And there's a lady over there she's acting pretty cool
    D                        C
But when it comes to playing life
    Em
She always plays the fool

         Em      C D   G    D   C
But it's too late  too late too late
C            Em
Too late for love

Too late  too late too late too late
