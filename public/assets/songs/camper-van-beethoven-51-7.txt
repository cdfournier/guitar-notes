I've been through all kind of changes
E           A                 E
Cut my hair dyed it blonde in stages
D                         A              E
 Been in trouble with the law but that's all over now
E                     A       E
I'm ready for the big time 51-7

E                        A                  E
Left home don't think my five brothers ever noticed
E                 A             E
Mom half-baked on weed and scientology
D               A        E
 My father if I ever find well don't you never mind
E                     A       E
I'm ready for the big time 51-7

E                  A                 E
Nothing to believe in except God and country
E                       A                            E
Can't stand to see them pushed around messed with or fucked up
D                         A                       E
