This is a story about a dog a dog
When I ride my bike
And my hair is blowing straight back
I think of you wearing that brown mohair sweater
Soft mounds of breasts underneath
Or better yet one of those squiggly aluminum lawn chairs
I'm putting sun tan lotion on your long legs
A-wearing a broad rim straw hat
Pair of Mickey mouse sunglasses
Looking just like Lolita
Looking just like Lolita
White sheets hanging on the line
White sheets blowing in the wind
A satellite dish pointed straight up at the heavens

G A C

Em
A satellite dish pointing
Em                 G       A
Straight up at the heavens Isis Isis

Em   G    A    C
Isis Isis Isis Isis
Em   G    A    C
Isis Isis Isis Isis
Em   G    A    C
Isis Isis Isis Isis
Em          G
Oh yeah Isis
