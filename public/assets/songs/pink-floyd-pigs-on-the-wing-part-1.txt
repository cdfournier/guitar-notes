G             C
If you didn't care
C                G
What happened to me
G            C
And I didn't care
C   G
For you

   A                G   A
We would zigzag our way
A           A7
Through the boredom and pain
G            C        D              G
Occasionally glancing up through the rain
Am        F            Am         F     C Am
Wondering which of the buggers to blame
Am  D                        G
And watching for pigs on the wing
