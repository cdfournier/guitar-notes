If you didn't care

What happened to me
G            C
And I didn't care
C   G  G C
For you

We would zigzag our way
G           A
Through the boredom and pain
G            C        D              G
Occasionally glancing up through the rain
Am        F            Am         F     C Am
Wondering which of the buggers to blame
Am  D                        G
And watching for pigs on the wing
