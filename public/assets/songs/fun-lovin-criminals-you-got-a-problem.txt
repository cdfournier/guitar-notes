I said 3 2 1 I'm that son of a gun
But one who has the fun by the kilo and the ton
Like Marv Albert but worse 
I got the curse got perverse with the nurse in the maternity ward
That's right I'm nuts ask Fisty Cuts
Got outpatient status at the Brooklyn Zoo
Doobie doobie doo we like the crew that
Runs up in the club wearin alligator shoes

My head feels like old vinyl and like Lionel I'm idle
Secretly stalking the title
Stealin scenes by ways and means
And thats why Marines got M-16's duck

Wonder why she got neglected
I legged it turned up here
I'll have a beer and a joke about that Guenevere
