E
Hold your fire
A               D
Keep it burning bright
E                      A     D
Hold the flame til the dream ignites
A               D           A
A spirit with a vision is a dream
A      E
With a mission

D
I hear their passionate music
G
Read the words that touch my heart
Bm
I gaze at their feverish pictures
A
The secrets that set them apart

D
When I feel the powerful visions
G
Their fire has made alive
Bm
I wish I had that instinct
A
I wish I had that drive

E
Spirits fly on dangerous missions
A
Imaginations on fire
Bm
Focused high on soaring ambitions
A
Consumed in a single desire

E
In the grip of a nameless possession
A
A slave to the drive of obsession
Bm              D           A
A spirit with a vision is a dream
A      E
With a mission

D
I watch their images flicker
G
Bringing light to a lifeless screen
Bm
I walk through their beautiful buildings
A
And I wish I had their dreams

D
But dreams don't need to have motion
G
To keep their spark alive
Bm
Obsession has to have action
A
Pride turns on the drive

E
It's cold comfort
A
To the ones without it
D
To know how they struggled
A
How they suffered about it

E
If their lives were exotic and strange
A
They would likely have gladly exchanged them
Bm                          D
For something a little more plain
D     A                       E
Maybe something a little more sane

E
We each pay a fabulous price
A
For our visions of paradise
Bm                  D           A
But a spirit with a vision is a dream
A      E
With a mission

Bm              D           A
A spirit with a vision is a dream
A      E
With a mission
