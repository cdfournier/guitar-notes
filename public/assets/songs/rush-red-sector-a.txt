All that we can do is just survive
Dm                                           G

Am
Ragged lines of ragged grey
Am                     G
Skeletons they shuffle away
G
Shouting guards and smoking guns
G
Will cut down the unlucky ones

  Am                             Em
I clutch the wire fence until my fingers bleed
  F
A wound that will not heal a heart that cannot feel
Am                     Em
Hoping that the horror will recede
F                                       Am
Hoping that tomorrow we'll all be freed

Am
Sickness to insanity
Am           G
Prayer to profanity
G
Days and weeks and months go by
G                         Am
Don't feel the hunger too weak to cry

Am                                 Em
I hear the sound of gunfire at the prison gate
F
Are the liberators here
F
Do I hope or do I fear
Am                           Em
For my father and my brother it's too late
    F                                       Dm
But I must help my mother stand up straight

Dm
Are we the last ones left alive
Dm                              G
Are we the only human beings to survive
Dm
Are we the last ones left alive
Dm                              G
Are we the only human beings to survive
