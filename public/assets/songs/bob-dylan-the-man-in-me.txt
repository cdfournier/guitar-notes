G                     Am
The man in me will do nearly any task
    D                           C               G
And as for compensation there’s little he would ask
G
Take a woman like you
G      C                       G
To get through to the man in me

G                       Am
Storm clouds are raging all around my door
  D                           C          G
I think to myself I might not take it anymore
G
Take a woman like your kind
G  C                 G
To find the man in me

    Am                  G
But oh what a wonderful feeling
Am                        G
Just to know that you are near
Am                 G
It sets my heart a-reeling
G       Am            D
From my toes up to my ears

G                                    Am
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen
    D
But that’s just because he doesn’t want
C                 G
To turn into some machine
G
Took a woman like you
       C                       G
To get through to the man in me
