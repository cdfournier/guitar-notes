D                    G              D
Is that the thanks I get for loving you
D                    G                       D
Is that the thanks I get for telling you the truth
G                 A
You say you wanna know
Em                A
Where I go when I go
Em                A
You say you wanna communicate
A                           G
But you don't hear a word I say

D                    G              D
Is that the thanks I get for loving you

I'm tired of the looks you give me when I get home late
D                                G                 D
And I'm getting tired of how you forget the loving things I say

G          A
I hold you tight
Em          A
I treat you right
Em               A
Now every time I go out to play
A                 G
Why you think I'm leaving

D                    G              D
Is that the thanks I get for loving you
D                           G
Now faith and trust are the strongest parts of us
D                   G                   A
That's okay but you must believe in our love

D
We can make it better

Let's pull ourselves together
    D     G  D
And start it again

You tuck me in at night
Em                 A
I don't ever wanna fight again
A                  G
I think we're both crazy

D                        G                  D
