In the world of sound

F                             G
It's in the way you're always hiding from the light

See for yourself you have been sitting on a time bomb
F                             G
No revolution maybe someone somewhere else

Could show you something new about you and your inner song

F                            G
And all the love and all the love in the world

Waste seeping underground (break it down again)

Big bouncing babies bread and butter can I have a slice
F                           G
They make no mention of the beauty of decay
Am                        G
Blue yellow pink umbrella save it for a rainy day

No more sleepy dreaming
