A D

                 A    D
If I had my time again
A       D             A   D
I would do it all the same
A       D               A    D
And not change a single thing
A           D      A    D
Even when I was to blame

A       D                 A   D
For the heartache and the pain
A      D                    A    D
That I caused throughout my years
A     D               A  D
How I learned to be a man
A           D                A    D
Through the laughter and the tears

A            D             A    D
Situation no win
A          D         A   D
Rush for a change of atmosphere
A          D            A    D
I can't go on so I give in
A         D            A     D
Gotta get myself right outta here

Now I'm fully grown
And I know where it's at
Somehow I stayed thin
While the other guys got fat

All the chances that I've blown
And the times that I've been down
I didn't get too high
Kept my feet on the ground

A            D             A    D
Situation no win
A          D         A   D
Rush for a change of atmosphere
A          D            A    D
I can't go on so I give in
A         D            A     D
Gotta get myself right outta here

Yes yes delightful delightful
Rush for a change of atmosphere
Mmm I wish I could sing like that
Not everything's singing you know
The only important thing these days is rhythm and melody
Rhythm
And melody

              A      D
And of all my friends
A               D       A D
You've been the best to me
A                D      A D
Soon will be the day
A      D         A       D
When I repay you handsomely

A      D          A       D
Broken hearts are hard to mend
A           D      A    D
I know I've had my share
A             D       A D
But life just carries on
A         D       A    D
Even when I'm not there

A            D             A    D
Situation no win
A          D         A   D
Rush for a change of atmosphere
A          D            A    D
I can't go on so I give in
A         D            A     D
Gotta get myself right outta here

A            D             A    D
Situation no win
A          D         A   D
Rush for a change of atmosphere
A          D            A    D
I can't go on so I give in
A         D            A     D
Gotta get myself right outta here


Gotta get myself right
Gotta get myself right
A                D    E    D    A
Gotta get myself right
A                D    E    D    A
Outta here

Gotta get myself right
Gotta get myself right
Gotta get myself right
Outta here
