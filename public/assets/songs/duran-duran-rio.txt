Em            C                       Am          C
Moving on the floor now babe you're a bird of paradise
Em               C       A                 C
Cherry ice cream smile I suppose it's very nice
C      Em                      C
With a step to your left and a flick to the right
C   Am                        C
You catch that mirror way out west
Em              C
You know you're something special
C       A                    C    E
And you look like you're the best

E           B           D             A
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
E              B              D               A
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
E            B                 D                 A
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
E      B         D              A
Oh Rio Rio dance across the Rio Grande

Em                   C              Am          C
I've seen you on the beach and I've seen you on TV
Em       C       A    C            Em
Two of a billion stars it mеans so much to me
C           Am              C
Like a birthday or a pretty viеw
Em           C             A                  C   E
But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand

Just like that river twisting through a dusty land

And when she shines she really shows you all she can
E      B         D              A
Oh Rio Rio dance across the Rio Grande

C      Em                   C
At the end of the drive the lawmen arrive
A                C           Em
You make me feel alive alive alive
C            Am           C             Em

I tell you something I know what you're thinking

E           B           D             A
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
E              B            D               A
Just like that river twists across a dusty land
E            B                 D                 A
And when she shines she really shows you all she can

Oh Rio Rio dance across the Rio Grande

E           B             D            A
Her name is Rio she don't need to understand
E           B               D              A
And I might find her if I'm looking like I can
E      B             D                A
Oh Rio Rio hear them shout across the land
E              B                 D          A
From mountains in the north down to the Rio Grand
