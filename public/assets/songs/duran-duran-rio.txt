Em            C                       Am          C
Moving on the floor now babe you're a bird of paradise
Em               C       A                 C
Cherry ice cream smile I suppose it's very nice
C      Em                      C
With a step to your left and a flick to the right
C   Am                        C
You catch that mirror way out west
Em              C
You know you're something special
C       A                    C    E
And you look like you're the best

E           B           D             A
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
E              B              D               A
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
E            B                 D                 A
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
E      B         D              A
Oh Rio Rio dance across the Rio Grande

Em                   C              Am          C
I've seen you on the beach and I've seen you on TV
Em       C       A    C            Em
Two of a billion stars it mеans so much to me
C           Am              C
Like a birthday or a pretty viеw
Em           C             A                  C   E
But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand

And when she shines she really shows you all she can
E      B         D              A
Oh Rio Rio dance across the Rio Grande

C      Em                   C
At the end of the drive the lawmen arrive

You make me feel alive alive alive

I tell you something I know what you're thinking

E           B           D             A
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
E              B            D               A
Just like that river twists across a dusty land
E            B                 D                 A

Oh Rio Rio dance across the Rio Grande

E           B             D            A
Her name is Rio she don't need to understand
E           B               D              A
And I might find her if I'm looking like I can
E      B             D                A
Oh Rio Rio hear them shout across the land
E              B                 D          A
From mountains in the north down to the Rio Grand
