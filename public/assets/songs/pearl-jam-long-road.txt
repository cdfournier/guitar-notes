D
And I wished for so long cannot stay
D
All the precious moments cannot stay
D
It's not like wings have fallen cannot stay
D
But still something's missing cannot say

G
Holding hands of daughters and sons
G                            D
And their faiths are falling down down down down
Em                   A
I have wished for so long
A                       D
How I wish for you today

D
Will I walk the long road cannot stay
D
There's no need to say goodbye

G
All the friends and family
G                      D
All the memories going round round round round
Em                   A
I have wished for so long
A                       D
How I wish for you today

C                  G
And the wind keeps rolling
G                         D
And the sky keeps turning gray
C
And the sun is set
C   G                     D
The sun will rise another day

Em                   A
I have wished for so long
A                       D
How I wish for you today
Em                   A
I have wished for so long
A                       D
How I wish for you today

D
Will I walk the long road
D
We all walk the long road
