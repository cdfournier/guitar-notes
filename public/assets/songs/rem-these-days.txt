Picked it up slapped it on my head

All the people gather fly to carry each his burden

We are young despite the years
C      Em             G                A
We are concern we are hope despite the times
Em       G            A
All of a sudden these days
A     C                 Em      G
Happy throngs take this joy wherever wherever

We have many things in common name three (three three three)
  G
I had a hat and it sunk reached down
Picked it up slapped it on my head
All the people gather fly to carry each his burden
We are young despite the years
We are concern we are hope despite the times
All of a sudden these days
Happy throngs take this joy wherever wherever you go
Now I'm not feeding off you
I will rearrange your scales if I can and I can
I wish to meet each one of you and you meet you
I had a hat and it sunk reached down
Picked it up slapped it on my head
All the people gather fly to carry each his burden
We are young despite the years
We are concern we are hope despite the times
All of the sudden these days
Happy throngs take this joy wherever wherever you
Carry each his burden we are young despite the years
We are concern we are hope despite the times
All of the sudden these days
Happy throngs take this joy
(Take away the scattered bones of my meal)
Wherever wherever you go
