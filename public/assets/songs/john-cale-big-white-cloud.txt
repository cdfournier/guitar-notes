D
When I stand my back to the sea
  G
A big white cloud looking right down at me
D
The sound of the sun piercing my eyes
G
Everything's clear everything's bright

D               A
Big white cloud big white cloud
G                  D
Big white cloud on me
D               A
Big white cloud big white cloud
G                  D
Big white cloud on me

D
Time to kill on a hill
G
Looking at leaves licking the trees
D
Looking for signs
G
Wind and the rain

D            A
Oh I love it yes I love it
G            D
Oh I love it so
D            A
Oh I love it yes I love it
G            D
Oh I love it so

D
After all is said and done
G
Everything is just like it began
D
Days that came years again
G
Came and went once again

D            A
Oh I love it yes I love it
G            D
Oh I love it so
D            A
Oh I love it yes I love it
G            D
Oh I love it so
D            A
Oh I love it yes I love it
G            D
Oh I love it so
