Story of my life

G           C                  D
High school seemed like such a blur
  G                C
I didn't have much interest
D
In sports or school elections
D      G       C           D
And in class I dreamed all day
D                    G      C D
Bout a rock and roll weekend

D       G           C            D
And the girl in the front of the room
   G            C
So close yet so far you know
D
She never seemed to notice
D         G     C         D
That this silly schoolboy crush
D           G      C D
Wasn't just pretend

G         C     D
Life goes by so fast
G              C                    D
You only wanna do what you think is right
G          C             D
Close your eyes and it's past

D     G               C   D
And I went down to my old neighborhood
    G              C
The faces have all changed
C              D
There's no one there left to talk to
D       G           C            D
And the pool hall I loved as a kid
D        G   C D
Is now a 7-11

D     G                C          D
And I went downtown to look for a job
  G      C           D
I had no training no experience to speak of
D     G             C           D
And I looked at the holes in my jeans
D                       G   C D
And I turned and headed back

G         C     D
Life goes by so fast
G              C                    D
You only wanna do what you think is right

D    G                   C          D
Yeah good times come and good times go
  G             C
I only wish the good times
C     D
Would last a little longer
  G               C            D
I think about the good times we had
D                   G  C D
And why they had to end

D    G          C          D
So I sit at the edge of my bed
  G        C            D
I strum my guitar and I sing an outlaw love song
G              C                 D
Thinking about what you're doing now
D                      G   C D
And when you're coming back

G         C     D
Life goes by so fast
G              C                    D
You only wanna do what you think is right
G          C             D
Close your eyes and it's past
