It was a beautiful day the sun beat down
E         D              E
I had the radio on I was driving
E                                            D
Trees went by me and Del were singing Little Runaway
D     E
I was flying

     D       G      E                      G       A
Yeah running down a dream that never would come to me
D            G     E       G           A
Working on a mystery going wherever it leads
A       G      E
Running down a dream

E
I felt so good like anything was possible
E   D                            E
Hit cruise control and rubbed my eyes
E
The last three days the rain was unstoppable
E      D              E
It was always cold no sunshine

     D       G      E                      G       A
Yeah running down a dream that never would come to me
D            G     E       G           A
Working on a mystery going wherever it leads
A       G      E
Running down a dream

E
I rolled on the sky grew dark
E         D                       E
I put the pedal down to make some time
E
There's something good waiting down this road
E   D                     E
I'm picking up whatever's mine

    D       G      E                      G       A
I'm running down a dream that never would come to me
D            G     E       G           A
Working on a mystery going wherever it leads
A       G      E
Running down a dream

     D       G      E                      G       A
Yeah running down a dream that never would come to me
D            G     E       G           A
Working on a mystery going wherever it leads
A       G      E
