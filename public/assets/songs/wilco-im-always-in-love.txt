D
Why I wonder is my heart full of holes
D
And the feeling goes but my hair keeps growing
G              Em
Will I set the sun
C                A
On a big-wheeled wagon
C                A
I'm bragging
A             D
I'm always in love

D
When I let go of your throat-sweet throttle
D
When I clean the lash of your black-belt model
G                Em
Will I catch the moon
C                A
Like a bird in a cage
C              A
It's for you I swoon
A             D
I'm always in love

G               Em
I don't get the connection
C                 A
If this is only a test
C              A
I hope I do my best
C               A
You know I wont forget

D
When I fold the cold in my jet-lag palm
D
When I soak so long I forget my mother
G              Em
Will I set the sun
C                A
On a big-wheeled wagon
C                A
I'm bragging
A             D
I'm always in love

C             A
It's a drag I snag
D             G   Em
I'm always in love
D
I'm worried
D
I'm always in love

D
I'm worried
D
I'm worried
D
I'm worried
D
I'm always in love
