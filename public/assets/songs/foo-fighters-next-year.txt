G              C
I'm in the sky tonight
G                   C
There I can keep by your side
G                       C
Watching the wide world riot
    A
And hiding out
C              D         G
I'll be coming home next year

G               C
Into the sun we climb
G                       C
Climbing our wings will burn white
G                    C
Everyone strapped in tight
      A
We'll ride it out
C              D         G
I'll be coming home next year

C           G
Come on get on get on
C                     G
Take it til life runs out
C
No one can find us now
A                          D
Living with our heads underground

G                 C
Into the night we shine
G                   C
Lighting the way we glide by
G                     C
Catch me if I get too high
     A
When I come down
C              D         G
I'll be coming home next year

G              C
I'm in the sky tonight
G                   C
There I can keep by your side
G                        C
Watching the whole world wind
 A
Around and round
C              D         G
I'll be coming home next year

C           G
Come on get on get on
C                  G
Take it til I fall down
C
No one can find us now
A                          D
Living with our heads underground

G              D         C
I'll be coming home next year
G              D         C

G              D        C
Everything's alright up here
       A
And if I come down
G              D         C
I'll be coming home next year

        A
Say goodbye
        C

And if I come down
