D         A        G            A
I used to love her but I had to kill her
D         A        G            A
I used to love her but I had to kill her
G        A       G        A
I had to put her six feet under
G         A              D
And I can still hear her complain

D         A        G            A
I used to love her but I had to kill her
D         A        G            A
I used to love her but I had to kill her
G          A        G           A
I knew I'd miss her so I had to keep her
G             A               D
She's buried right in my back yard

D         A        G            A
I used to love her but I had to kill her
D         A        G            A
I used to love her but I had to kill her
G              A    G            A
She bitched so much she drove me nuts
G             A            D
And now we're happier this way
