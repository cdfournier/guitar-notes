G
I don't care about the state of my hair
G     C
I got something out of nothing
C
That just wasn't there
C        G
And your kiss kiss kiss
   F                   G
Is never gonna blow me away

G
Dreams of escape keep me awake
    C
I'm never gonna get out and make it away
C     G
I'm a stone dead tripper
F                G
Dying in a fantasy

G      C
Like a cracked open sky it helps you to die
C
Don't split it scrape it
C                          G
You're screaming automatic pain
F
Too young kid you're gonna get hit
F
Looks like you're never gonna make it
F                  G
Off the government list

G
I don't mind about the state of my mind
G       C
But you know it's good for nothing
C
And I left you behind
C      G
It's a sick sick city
G        F                   G
But it's never gonna make me insane

G
If you're talking for real
G
Then go cut a deal
G      C
You're facing up to living out the way that you feel
C       G
And you shake shake shake
G         F                         G
Cause you know you'll never make it away

G      C
Like a cracked open sky it helps you to die
C
Don't split it scrape it
C                          G
You're screaming automatic pain
