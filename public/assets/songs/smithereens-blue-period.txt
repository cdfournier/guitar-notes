Blue period black comedy
G      A         D
Such a joke I've played on me
D
I let you go
D              G       A    D
And now I know a world of uncertainty

G     A               D
Now I think about the days
G      A               D
When I let you down in so many ways
G          A              D
That's the time I want to cry
D       A             F  Em    A
And the time I wonder why and  pray

D
My apathy is tragedy
G      A       D
I'm content to stay inside
D
This emptiness is killing me
G     A         D
I can run but I can't hide

G       A            D
And you loved me all along
G      A              D
When I always did you wrong
G          A            D
That's the time I can't forget
D      A             F    Em A
And it fills me with regret  always
