D Bm A G Em E C

C       D
It's at times such as this she'd be tempted to spit
Bm                   A
If she wasn't so ladylike
    G                           D
She imagines how she might have lived
D                     Em
Back when legends and history collide
       D                                   Bm
So she looks to her prince finding he's so charmingly
               A
Slumped at her side
      G                        D
Those days are recalled on the gallery wall
          Bm                     E
And she's waiting for passion or humor to strike

A                G
What shall we do what shall we do with all this useless beauty
G        A       D
All this useless beauty

D
Good Friday arrived the sky darkened on time
       Bm                   A
Til he almost began to negotiate
G                        D                  Em            A
She held his head like a baby and said it's okay if you cry
       D
Now he wants her to dress as if you couldn't guess
   Bm                          A
He desires to impress his associates
         G                   D
But he's part ugly beast and Hellenic deceased
       Bm                        E
So she finds that the mixture is hard to deny

A                G
What shall we do what shall we do with all this useless beauty
G        A       D
All this useless beauty

          C                           D            G
She won't practice the looks from the great tragic books
          G                       Em
That were later disgraced to face celluloid
         C               D           G
It won't even make sense but you can bet
       C                     D            G
If she isn't a sweetheart or plaything or pet
    C                          A
The film turns her into an unveiled threat

D
Nonsense prevails modesty fails
          Bm                     A
Grace and virtue turn into stupidity
          G                     D                   Em             A
While the calendar fades almost all barricades to a pale compromise
        D
And our leaders have feasts on the backsides of beasts
           Bm                              A
They still think they're the gods of antiquity
   G                           D
If something you missed didn't even exist
       Bm                  E
It was just an ideal is it such a surprise

A                G
What shall we do what shall we do with all this useless beauty
G        A       D
All this useless beauty

A                G
What shall we do what shall we do with all this useless beauty
G        A       D
All this useless beauty
