D
Guess it's just another dream
A
That's slipping away
D
Each time I fall asleep
A
It seems drifting away

D
Just as you have touched my heart
E
Babe I wake and we're apart
A             E            A
Yeah and it's slipping away

D
Here comes just another day
A
That's drifting away
D
Every time I draw a breath
A
It's dying away

D
First the sun and then the moon
E                         A
One of them will be round soon
E            A
Slipping away
E            A
Slipping away

D            A
Drifting away
D            A
Slipping away

D
Just as you have touched my heart
E
I wake up babe and we're apart
A              E        A
It seems we're slipping away
E        A
Slipping away
E        A
Slipping away

C             F
All I want is ecstasy
    C               F
But I ain't getting much
     C              F
Just getting off on misery
   C                  F    E A
It seems I've lost my touch

D
Well it's just another song
A
But it's slipping away
D
Well we didn't sing it long
A
Cause it's fading away

D
First the sun and then the moon 
E                             A
One of them will be round soon
E            A
Slipping away
E            A
Slipping away
E            A
Slipping away
