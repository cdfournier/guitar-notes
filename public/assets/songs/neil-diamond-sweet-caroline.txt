A             D
Where it began
D
I can't begin to know when
A                            E
But then I know it's growing strong
A                D
Was in the spring
D
And spring became the summer
A                              E
Who'd have believed you'd come along

A    F#m
Hands
F#m           E
Touching hands
E           D
Reaching out
D                    E
Touching me touching you

A         D
Sweet Caroline
D                          E
Good times never seemed so good
A           D
I've been inclined
D                     E
To believe they never would
D
But now I

A                D
Look at the night
D
And it don't seem so lonely
A                       E
We fill it up with only two
A              D
And when I hurt
D
Hurting runs off my shoulders
A                           E
How can I hurt when holding you

A   F#m
Warm
F#m          E
Touching warm
E           D
Reaching out
D                    E
Touching me touching you

A         D
Sweet Caroline
D                          E
Good times never seemed so good
A           D
I've been inclined
D                     E
To believe they never would
D
Oh no no
