A G C

A         G                       C
I saw her yeah I saw her with her black tongue tied
A
Round the roses
A                  G
Fist pounding on a vending machine
C                A
Toy diamond ring stuck on her finger
A
With a noose she can hang from the sun
G                       C
And put it out with her dark sunglasses
A
Walking crooked down the beach
    G                             C         E
She spits on the sand where their bones are bleaching

E     G                        D
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
D                            E
She doesn't even know what's wrong
E     G                       D
And I know I'm gonna make her die
D                       E
Take her where her soul belongs
E     G                        F#m
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
F
Nothing that I wouldn't try

E   D           A
Hey my sun-eyed girl
E   D           A
Hey my sun-eyed girl
E   D           A

E   D           A
Hey my sun-eyed girl

A         G                       C
I saw her yeah I saw her with her hands tied back
C       A
And her rags were burning
A        G                     C
Crawling out from a landfilled life
C             A
Scrawling her name upon the ceiling
A
Throw a coin in a fountain of dust
G               C
White noise her ears are ringing
A
Got a ticket for a midnight hanging
G                     C             E
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving

E     G                        D
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
D                            E
She doesn't even know what's wrong
E     G                       D
And I know I'm gonna make her die
D                       E
Take her where her soul belongs
E     G                        F#m
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
F
Nothing that I wouldn't try
