Sitting so cool and nonchalant

Dragging on a cigarette

G
You stand like a marble statue

Trying to look so hard
C                      G
All decked out in your antique dress
G         Em            C
While the boys all promenade
G
Even a rock will crumble
G      C
If you strike it night and day
C                          G
If hammer I must I'm gonna get through your crust
