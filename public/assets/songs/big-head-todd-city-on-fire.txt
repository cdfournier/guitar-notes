Am

G            Em     C     G
Woke up this morning in a bed
C    G
In a bed of fire
G          Em       C      G
People and buildings in my head
C       G
Burning there tonight

Em         A
Tonight as I lay sleeping
  C                F
I try to hold your hand
Em               A
One eye open and dreaming
A         C          F
That this city is on fire

Am G Em C G

G       Em
Tell me sweet things
Em     C             G
In the middle of the night
C        G
It's the middle of the night
G       Em             C       G
Open my window and the room is filled
C           G
Filled with burning light

Em         A
Tonight as I lay sleeping
  C                F
I try to hold your hand
Em               A
One eye open and dreaming
A         C          F
That this city is on fire
