Ever since you've been leaving me I've been wanting to cry
A                 G         A                        G
Now I know how it feels for you I've been wanting to die
         C        Bm           A             C        Bm           A

Time has gone since I've been with you and we've been starting to die
A                      G        A                         G
Now it seems you don't care for me and I don't understand why
         C        Bm           A             C        Bm           A
But it's much too late for goodbyes yes it's much too late for goodbyes

A                      G     A                       G
Ever since you've been far away I've been wanting to fly
A                   G        A                         G
Now I know what you meant to me I'm the one who should cry
         C        Bm           A             C        Bm           A
And it's much too late for goodbyes yes it's much too late for goodbyes
