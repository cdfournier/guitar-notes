A                      G
Ever since you've been leaving me 
A                    G
I've been wanting to cry
A                 G
Now I know how it feels for you 
A                    G
I've been wanting to die

         C        Bm           A
But it's much too late for goodbyes
         C        Bm           A
Yes it's much too late for goodbyes

A                        G
Time has gone since I've been with you
A                          G
And we've been starting to die
A                      G
Now it seems you don't care for me
A                    G
And I can understand why

         C        Bm           A
But it's much too late for goodbyes
         C        Bm           A
Yes it's much too late for goodbyes

A                      G
Ever since you've been far away
A                    G
I've been wanting to fly
A                   G
Now I know what you meant to me
A                      G
I'm the one who should cry
