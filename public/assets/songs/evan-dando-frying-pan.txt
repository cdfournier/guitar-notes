D   Em                       G
One laugh in the middle of a struggle
D    Em                      G
A diamond at the bottom of a puddle
G                              A
Did you ever stare at the moon til you saw double
D          Em             G
I hear you walk away from trouble

D        Em              G
Good love there ain't no denying
     D       Em              G
Said bad love somebody ain't trying
G                           A
Did you ever walk someplace just to take time
D           Em                G
Or take the fast road and get going

G
Then the rules break
A
There's no mistake
D         Em
These are precious times
G                         D Em G
You and I we walk the line
G               D Em G
We walk the line

G
I looked in a frying pan
A
I sang a song
G
I looked at a dying man
A
He sang along

A      D        Em G
We got mountains
G      D        Em G
We got beaches
G      D                  Em
We got love that makes us mad
G                      A
Love that has to teach us

G
I looked in a frying pan
A
I sang a song
G
I looked at a dying man
A
He sang along

D Em G - D Em G

G
Then the rules break
A
There's no mistake
D         Em
These are precious times
G                         D Em G
You and I we walk the line
G               D Em G
We walk the line
