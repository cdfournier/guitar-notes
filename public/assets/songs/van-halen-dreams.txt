Am                    F
World turns black and white
G                    Am
Pictures in an empty room
     F                   G
Your love starts falling down
       Am
Better change your tune
Am       F                    G
Yeah you reach for the golden ring
Am
Reach for the sky
Am        F           G
Baby just spread your wings

G       C          Am
And get higher and higher
Am       Em       F
Straight up we'll climb
F         C          Am
We'll get higher and higher
Am       F   G
Leave it all behind

Am          F
Run run run away
F      G                     Am
Like a train running off the track
Am      F                G
Got the truth being left behind
     Am
Fall between the cracks
F                  G
Standing on broken dreams
      Am
Never losing sight
Am        F           G
Well just spread your wings

G       C          Am
And get higher and higher
Am       Em       F
Straight up we'll climb
F         C          Am
We'll get higher and higher
Am       F   G
Leave it all behind

G       Em       F
So baby dry your eyes
     Am                   G
Save all the tears you've cried
   F           Am         G
Oh that's what dreams are made of
G     Em F
Cause we belong
F    Am                 G
In a world that must be strong
G  F           Am         G
Oh that's what dreams are made of

Dm G C Am

Am             C          Am
Yeah we'll get higher and higher
Am       Em            F
Straight up we'll climb
C          Am
Higher and higher
Am       F         G
Leave it all behind
G            C          Am
Oh we'll get higher and higher
    Em                   F
Who knows what we'll find

F       Em       F
So baby dry your eyes
     Am                   G
Save all the tears you've cried
   F           Am         G
Oh that's what dreams are made of

G       Em F
Oh baby we belong
F    Am                 G
In a world that must be strong
   F           Am         G
Oh that's what dreams are made of

Em F Am G - F Am C G

    Em     F
And in the end
   Am             G
On dreams we will depend
      F           Am
Cause that's what love is made of
