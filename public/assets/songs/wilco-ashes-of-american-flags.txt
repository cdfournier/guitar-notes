D               G
The cash machine is blue and green
D                        G
For a hundred in twenties and a small service fee
Em                         A
I could spend three dollars and sixty-three cents
D                G
On Diet Coca-Cola and unlit cigarettes

Em                                   A
I wonder why we listen to poets when nobody gives a fuck
D                     G
How hot and sorrowful this machine begs for luck

F#m    G                     D
All my lies are always wishes
Em             A
I know I would die if I could come back new

D                  G
We want a good life with a nose for things
D                            G
The fresh wind and bright sky to enjoy my suffering
Em                        A
A hole without a key if I break my tongue
D                    G
Speaking of tomorrow how will it ever come

F#m    G                     D
All my lies are always wishes
Em             A
I know I would die if I could come back new

D G D G

Em
I'm down on my hands and knees
A
Every time a doorbell rings
D
I shake like a toothache
G
When I hear myself sing

F#m    G                     D
All my lies are always wishes
Em             A
I know I would die if I could come back new

D
I would like to salute
G
The ashes of American flags
D
And all the fallen leaves
G
Filling up shopping bags
