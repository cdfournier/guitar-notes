If I had to lose a mile
E                 D
If I had to touch feelings
D               C
I would lose my soul
    D     E
The way I do

E
I don't have to think
E              D
I only have to do it
D                      C
The results are always perfect
    D          E
And that's old news

E
Would you like to hear my voice
E              D
Sprinkled with emotion
C                 E
 Invented at your birth

G       E       G      E
I can't see the end of me
G        E       G        E
My whole expanse I cannot see
E           C      D
I formulate infinity
D                   E
And store it deep inside me
