Checkmate honey beat you at your own damn game
E                                         A
No dice honey I'm living on a astral plane
E                                                        A
Feet's on the ground and your head's going down the drain
   D                     E                 G
Oh heads I win tails you lose to the never mind
G                    A
When to draw the line

E                                          A
Indian summer Carrie was all over the floor
E                                                      A
She was a wet nap winner and rarely ever left the store
E                                                             A
She'd sing and dance all night and wrong all the right outta me
   D                               E                     G
Oh pass me the vial and cross your fingers it don't take time
  G                 A
Nowhere to draw the line

Hi ho silver we were singing all your cowboy songs
E                                                       A
Oh you told Carrie and promised her you wouldn't be long
D                     E                     G
Heads I win tails you lose lord it's such a crime
D                     E                            G
No dice honey you the salt you're the queen of the brine
E                          D                     E
Checkmate honey you're the only one who's got to choose
E                 A
Where to draw the line
