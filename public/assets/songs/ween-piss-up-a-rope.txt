G
My dinner's on fire while she watches TV
    C
And if you've ever wondered what it's like to be me
    G
She takes all my money and leaves me no smokes
D
Yells at my buddies and insults my folks
    G
I'm breaking my back doing the best that I can
          C
She's got time for the dog and none for her man
    G               D
And I'm no dope but I can't cope
                            G
So hit the fucking road and piss up a rope

        G
You can piss up a rope
            C
And you can put on your shoes hit the road get trucking
G
Pack your bag I don't need the ag
        D
On your knees you big booty bitch start sucking
    G
You ride my ass like a horse in a saddle
           C
Now you're up shits creek with a turd for a paddle
G                D         G
And I can't cope piss up a rope

G
Uh you can piss up a rope and feel the pissy dribble
        C
You can piss up a rope and watch me giggle
        G
For the last 6 months I been packing your bag
        D
You can wash my balls with a warm wet rag
       G
Til my balls feel smooth and soft like silk
    C
I'm sick of your mouth and your 2 percent milk
    G                    D
And I'm no dope but I've lost all hope
                            G
So hit the fucking road and piss up a rope

        G
You can piss up a rope
            C
And you can put on your shoes hit the road get trucking
G
Pack your bag I don't need the ag
        D
On your knees you big booty bitch start sucking
    G
You ride my ass like a horse in a saddle
           C
Now you're up shits creek with a turd for a paddle
G                D         G
And I can't cope piss up a rope
