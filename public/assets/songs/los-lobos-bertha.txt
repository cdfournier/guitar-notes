G C D Am

G       C
I had a hard run
C                 G     C
Running from your window
C
I was all night running
C                    G     C
Lord I wonder if you care
C
I had a run-in
C                  G     C
Run around and run down
C
Run around the corner
C                       G     C
Lord I run smack into a tree

C        D   Am
I had to move
G             C  D
Really had to move
C                 G
That's why if you please
G    D            C
I am on my bended knees
Am                    C           G
Bertha don't you come around here anymore

G                 C
Dressed myself in green
C                  G     C
I went down to the sea
C
Try to see what's going down
C                            G     C
Lord try to read between the lines
C
Had a feeling I was falling falling falling
C                       G     C
Lord I turned around to see
C
Heard a voice calling
C                         G     C
Lord you was coming after me

C        D   Am
I had to move
G             C  D
Really had to move
C                 G
That's why if you please
G    D            C
I am on my bended knees
Am                    C           G
Bertha don't you come around here anymore

G  C G

G          C
Ran into a rainstorm
C                      G     C
Ducked back into a bar door
C
It was all night pouring pouring rain
C                      G     C
Lord but not a drop on me
C
Test me test me test me test me
C                    G     C
Why don't you arrest me
C
Throw me into the jail house
C                       G     C
Lord until the sun goes down

C        D   Am
I had to move
G             C  D
Really had to move
C                 G
That's why if you please
G    D            C
I am on my bended knees
Am                    C           G
Bertha don't you come around here anymore
