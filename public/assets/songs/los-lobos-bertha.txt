G C D Am

G       C
I had a hard run
C                 G
Running from your window
G               C
I was all night running
C                    G
Lord I wonder if you care
G       C
I had a run-in
C                  G
Run around and run down
G              C
Run around the corner
C                       G
Lord I run smack into a tree

G        D   Am
I had to move
G             C  D
Really had to move
C                 G
That's why if you please
G    D            C
I am on my bended knees
Am                    C           G
Bertha don't you come around here anymore

G                 C
Dressed myself in green
C                  G
I went down to the sea
G                 C
Try to see what's going down
C                            G
Lord try to read between the lines
G                   C
Had a feeling I was falling falling falling
C                       G
Lord I turned around to see
G             C
Heard a voice calling
C                         G
Lord you was coming after me

G        D   Am
I had to move
G             C  D
Really had to move
C                 G
That's why if you please
G    D            C
I am on my bended knees
Am                    C           G
Bertha don't you come around here anymore

G  C G

G          C
Ran into a rainstorm
C                      G
Ducked back into a bar door
G                C
It was all night pouring pouring rain
C                      G
Lord but not a drop on me
G               C
Test me test me test me test me
C                    G
Why don't you arrest me
G                 C
Throw me into the jail house
C                       G
Lord until the sun goes down

G        D   Am
I had to move
G             C  D
Really had to move
C                 G
That's why if you please
G    D            C
I am on my bended knees
Am                    C           G
Bertha don't you come around here anymore

G        D   Am
I had to move
G             C  D
Really had to move
C                 G
That's why if you please
G    D            C
I am on my bended knees
Am                    C           G
