Well my pad is very messy and there's whiskers on my chin
E
And I'm all hung up on music and I always play to win
E
I ain't got no time for loving cause my time is all used up
E
Just to sit around creating all that groovy kind of stuff

G                   F#
But I'm a man yes I am
F#    F              E
And I can't help but love you so no no no
G                   F#
But I'm a man yes I am
F#    F              E
And I can't help but love you so

E
Well if I had my choice of matter I would rather be with cats
E
All engrossed in mental chatter going where our minds are at
E
And relating to each other just how strong our wills can be
E
In resisting all involvement with each groovy chick we see

G               F#
I'm a man yes I am
F#    F              E
And I can't help but love you so
G                   F#
But I'm a man yes I am
F#    F              E
And I can't help but love you so no let me tell you now I said

E
I got to keep my image while suspended from a throne
E
That looks out upon a kingdom with people all unknown
E
Who imagine I'm not human and my heart is made of stone
E
And I've never had no problems and my toilet's trimmed with chrome

G               F#
I'm a man yes I am
F#    F              E
And I can't help but love you so no no no no no no
G               F#
I'm a man yes I am
F#    F              E
And I can't help but love you so
