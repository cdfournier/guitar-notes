D      G                A
Woe is me and I've been dying
D               G             A
Got to get that monkey off my back

E

D                  G              A
The fortune teller looked into my eyeballs
D                   G             A
The wrinkles on her face about to crack
D
She said you best believe it
G                 A
You ain't going nowhere
D                   G               E
Unless you get that monkey off your back

E    D                  G             A
Well I made believe the devil made me do it
D              G             A
I was the evil leader of the pack
D                  G                     A
You best believe I had it all and then I blew it
D                    G            E
Feeding that fucking monkey on my back

E A

C                                 E
If you put it a spoon man I would boot it
C                                       E
Some king whose mental house was just a shack
C                               E
Where do you draw the line when all your friends are dying
C
You got to get that monkey off your back

E

D                    G                   A
Your crystal ball is where you chase the dragon
D                     G                      A
She said now bring me home his head inside a sack
    D                 G                 A
But now you find your crystal balls are dragging
D               G               E
Got to get that monkey off your back
