Out where the river broke
The bloodwood and the desert oak
Holden wrecks and boiling diesels
Steam in forty-five degrees

The time has come to say fair's fair
   A               E
To pay the rent to pay our share
    E               D
The time has come a fact's a fact
   A                     F#
It belongs to them let's give it back

How do we sleep while our beds are burning

Four wheels scare the cockatoos
From Kintore East to Yuendemu
The Western Desert lives and breathes
In forty-five degrees
