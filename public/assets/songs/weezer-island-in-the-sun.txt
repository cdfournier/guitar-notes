When you're on a holiday
Am        D        G        Em Am
You can't find the words to say

All the things that come to you
Am    D     G       Em Am
And I wanna feel it too

Am    D      G      Em Am
On an island in the sun
Am       D           G      Em Am
We'll be playing and having fun

Just a place to call your own
Am    D     G        Em Am
As we drift into the zone
