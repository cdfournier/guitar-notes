When you're on a holiday
Am        D        G        Em Am
You can't find the words to say
Am      D           G       Em Am
All the things that come to you
Am    D     G       Em Am
And I wanna feel it too

Am    D      G      Em Am
On an island in the sun
Am       D           G      Em Am
We'll be playing and having fun
Am     D        G       Em
And it makes me feel so fine
  Am       D       G

You don't need no memory
Am     D        G         Em Am
Just a place to call your own
Am    D     G        Em Am
As we drift into the zone
