G           F
When red is bled
F          G
And petals blue
G                   Em
And in my sleepless head
Em              C
Our love's been dead a week or two
Am
Sometimes good times
Am        C         Am
Are stuck inside of you
Am               G
And then they're gone
F                C
But I don't know why
Em
A lot of things have changed
Em       C
Since we said goodbye
C
There were reasons for you to love me
D
But I gave you none
     Am
So I tap my glass and nod my chin
    C                 Am             G
And wonder who you've been in rhythm with

G              F
So time's just time
G          F
Cars can't escape
G                        Em
When clouds are gray and close
Em        C
Not often too far away
Am                    C        Am
And blue has no value power or hue
   G          F       C
Or open skies relationless
Am
Carelessness is what I miss
Am         C
And that's how I think of you
C
Sometimes good times
C    D
Were all we had to do
     Am
So I tap my glass and nod my chin
    C                 Am             G
And wonder who you've been in rhythm with
     Am
So I tap my glass and nod my chin
    C                 Am             G
And wonder who you've been in rhythm with
