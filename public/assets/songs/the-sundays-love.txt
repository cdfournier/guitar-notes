Picture myself as a thin white child
G
Back to the day I was born on
G                               F
They slapped me into line as it crossed my mind
F         Am               C

They can say what they like but they still can't take that

G
Distance myself from the things I'd like but
G
Everyone has something I need

Picture a bomb in the sky
G
History at your door
G         F
Who could ask for more
