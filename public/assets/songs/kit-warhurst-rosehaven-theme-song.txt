        G
Yeah we know
G                        D
Even if we had so far to go
D                   Am
Even if the pace is slow
Am           C                  G
Well I'll be coming home to you again

G
If we find
G                           D
Something to feel that we belong
D                       Am
If we can right all the wrongs
Am           C                  G
Well I'll be coming home to you again
