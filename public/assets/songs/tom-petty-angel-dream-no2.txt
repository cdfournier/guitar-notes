I dreamed you I saw your face
C
Cut my lifeline when drifting through space
C        Am             C
I saw an angel I saw my faith
      F          C          G       C
I can only thank God it was not too late

C
Over mountains I floated away
C
Across an ocean I dreamed her name
C             Am                     C
I followed an angel down through the gates
      F          C          G       C
I can only thank God it was not too late

Am                    G
Sing a little song of loneliness
C                   F
Sing one to make me smile
Am                G
Another round for everyone
    C                 F    G
I'm here for a little while

        C
Now I'm walking this street on my own
C
But she's with me everywhere I go
C               Am               C
Yeah I found an angel I found my place
      F          C          G       C
I can only thank God it was not too late
      F          C          G       C
I can only thank God it was not too late
      F          C          G       C
I can only thank God it was not too late
