D A C G

D              A
I can't get to sleep
C                 G
I think about the implications
D                A
Of diving in too deep
C                G
And possibly the complications
D             A
Especially at night
C            G
I worry over situations
D              A
I know will be alright
C                 G
Perhaps it's just imagination

D         A      G
Day after day it reappears
D           A                  C         G
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
D      A               G
Ghosts appear and fade away

D                 A
Alone between the sheets
C           G
Only brings exasperation
D                     A
It's time to walk the streets
C         G
Smell the desperation
D                       A
At least there's pretty lights
C                         G
And though there's little variation
D                A
It nullifies the night
C    G
From overkill

D         A      G
Day after day it reappears
D           A                  C         G
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
D      A               G
Ghosts appear and fade away
G                 D
Come back another day
