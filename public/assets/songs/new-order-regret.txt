Maybe I've forgotten

Save it for another day

It's the school exam
C                 D
The kids have run away

I would like a place I could call my own
D
Have a conversation on the telephone
G
Wake up every day that would be a start
D
I would not complain of my wounded heart
G                  D
I was upset you see almost all the time
G                        D
You used to be a stranger now you are mine

  G
I wouldn't even trust you
     C
I've not got much to give
      G
We're dealing in the limits and
C
We don't know who with
Em                     Bm
You may think that I'm out of hand
Bm   C

C  D             Bm
On this occasion it's not true

G                           D
You were a complete stranger now you are mine

Just before they fall apart
