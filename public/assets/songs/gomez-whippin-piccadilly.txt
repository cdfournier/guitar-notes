Once upon a time not too long ago
A                    D
We took a day out in Manchester
D      A
We all fall down
A       C          D            A
There's not enough hours in our day

A
Played a bit of football fell into the union
A                       D
Barged our way into the toilet
D        A
With the kung fu king
A       C          D            A
There's not enough hours in the day

I remember seeing someone dressed in a suit
A              D
Looking like a lunatic
D               A
And we all fall down
A       C          D            A
There's not enough hours in our trip

A
Well academy cogwheels breaking your hand
A                             D
But we got lovely posters for sale
D      A
And we all fall down
A       C          D            A
There's not enough hours in our day

A
We like loving yeah and the wine we share

Finally made our way back to the train
A                      D
Rolling into Sheffield tonight
D      A
And we all fall down
A       C          D            A
There's not enough hours in our life

A
So try and guess my weight waiting at the station
A                    D
Whippin Piccadilly tonight
D      A
And it all falls down
A       C          D            A
There's not enough hours in our life

A
We like loving yeah and the wine we share
