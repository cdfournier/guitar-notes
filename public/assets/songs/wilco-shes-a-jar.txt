G Bm C - G Bm C

C       G
She's a jar
G            Bm
With a heavy lid
   C
My pop quiz kid
C        G
A sleepy kisser
G        Bm
A pretty war with feelings hid
C
She begs me not to miss her

G Bm C - G Bm C

C        G
She says forever
G            Bm
To light a fuse
C
We could use a hand full of wheel
G
And a day off
Bm
On a bruised road
C
However you might feel
G              Bm C
Tonight is real

G Bm C

C      G             Bm
When I forget how to talk I sing
C
Won't you please
G          G
Bring that flash to shine
    Bm
And turn my eyes red
C
Unless they close when you click
C                G
And my face gets sick
Bm           C
Stuck like a question unposed

G Bm C - G Bm C

G          Am
Just climb aboard
    D           Ebm
The tracks of a train's arm
Em                   Bm Bbm Am
In my fragile family tree
Am           D        Ebm
And watch me floating inches above
Ebm             D
The people underneath

G Bm C - G Bm C

G        Bm             C
Please beware the quiet front yard I warned you
C      G
Before there were water skies
Bm
I warned you not to drive
C
Dry your eyes you poor devil

G Bm C - G Bm C

G                Bm
Are there really ones like these
C
The ones I dream float like leaves
    G                Bm
And freeze to spread skeleton wings
C
I passed through before I knew you

G Bm C - G Bm C

G                   Bm
I believe it's just because
Bm      C
Daddy's payday is not enough
   G                  Bm
Oh I believe it's all because
Bm      C
Daddy's payday is not enough

G Bm C - G Bm C

G          Am
Just climb aboard
    D           Ebm
The tracks of a train's arm
Em                   Bm Bbm Am
In my fragile family tree
Am           D        Ebm
And watch me floating inches above
Ebm              D
The people under me

G Bm C - G Bm C

C       G
She's a jar
G            Bm
With a heavy lid
   C
My pop quiz kid
C        G
A sleepy kisser
G        Bm
A pretty war with feelings hid
C
You know she begs me not to hit her
