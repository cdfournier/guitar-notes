Friday night I'm going nowhere
G                           D           G
All the lights are changing green to red
D
Turning over TV stations
G                          D      G
Situations running through my head
D
Looking back through time
     G                               D          G
It's clear that I've been blind I've been a fool
D
To open up my heart to all that
G                        D        G   Em
Jealousy that bitterness that ridicule

D
Saturday I'm running wild
G                               D           G
And all the lights are changing red to green
D
Moving through the crowds I'm pushing
G                           D         G
Chemicals are rushing in my bloodstream
D
Only wish that you were here
D            G
You know I'm seeing it so clear
G         D      G
I've been afraid
D
To show you how I really feel
G                             D          G
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made

D                  A
And if you want it come and get it
Em             F#m
For crying out loud
D                   A
The love that I was giving you was
Em       G
Never in doubt
D           A                 Em
Let go your heart let go your head
Em          A
And feel it now
D           A                 Em
Let go your heart let go your head
Em          A
And feel it now

D
Sunday all the lights of London
G                     D          G
Shining sky is fading red to blue
D
Kicking through the autumn leaves
    G                               D        G
And wondering where it is you might be going to
D
Turning back for home you know 
    G                        D      G
I'm feeling so alone I can't believe
D
Climbing on the stair I turn around
   G                        D        G
To see you smiling there in front of me

D                  A
And if you want it come and get it
Em             F#m
For crying out loud
D                   A
The love that I was giving you was
Em       G
Never in doubt
D           A                 Em
Let go your heart let go your head
Em          A
And feel it now
D           A                 Em
Let go your heart let go your head
Em          A
And feel it now
