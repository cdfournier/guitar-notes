C                    F
Trudging slowly over wet sand
F           C                             F
Back to the bench where your clothes were stolen
F                   G
This is the coastal town
C                         F
That they forgot to close down
F
Armageddon come armageddon
F               G
Come armageddon come

C    G           F
Everyday is like Sunday
C           G          F
Everyday is silent and grey

C
Hide on the promenade
C      F
Etch a postcard
F     C                     F
How I dearly wish I was not here
F              G
In the seaside town
C                   F
That they forgot to bomb
F                      G
Come come come nuclear bomb

C    G           F
Everyday is like Sunday
C           G          F
Everyday is silent and grey

C                              F
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
C                                G
And a strange dust lands on your hands
G           F
And on your face
F       G
On your face
G       F
On your face
F       G
On your face

C    G           F
Everyday is like Sunday
C       G            F
Win yourself a cheap tray
C          G                F
Share some greased tea with me
C           G          F
Everyday is silent and grey
