D         A                        D
I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
D      A                           D
That I almost believe that they're real
D         A                      D
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
D      A                       D                      A
That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel

D A D

  A                      D
Remembering you standing quiet in the rain
D    A                       D
As I ran to your heart to be near
D      A                         D
And we kissed as the sky fell in holding you close
D     A                         D
How I always held close in your fear

  A                     D
Remembering you running soft through the night
D        A                       D
You were bigger and brighter and whiter than snow
    A                            D
And screamed at the make believe screamed at the sky
D       A                      D                     A
And you finally found all your courage to let it all go

D A D

  A                     D
Remembering you falling into my arms
A                            D
Crying for the death of your heart
D        A
You were stone white so delicate
D
Lost in the cold
D        A                     D
You were always so lost in the dark

  A                 D
Remembering you how you used to be
D    A
Slow drowned you were angels
   D
So much more than everything
A                           D
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
A                  D
Open my eyes but I never see anything

   E                       D
If only I'd thought of the right words
  E                          D
I could have held on to your heart
   E                       D
If only I'd thought of the right words
  E                    D                        A
I wouldn't be breaking apart all my pictures of you

A                        D
Looking so long at these pictures of you
D     A                     D
But I never hold on to your heart
A                       D
Looking so long for the words to be true
D   A                    D
But always just breaking apart
                  A
My pictures of you

There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more
Bm      A                   D
Than to feel you deep in my heart
D         A                           D
There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more
D       E                       D
Than to never feel the breaking apart

My pictures of you
