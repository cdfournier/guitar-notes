G      F                 C         Am
One by one the teardrops fall as I write you
G      F                 C              Am
One by one my words come falling on the page
G      F                  C            Am
One by one my dreams are fading in the twilight
G      F                  C           Am
One by one my schemes are fading fast away

G      F               C               Am
One by one the flowers fade here in my garden
G      F                  C                Am
One by one the leaves are falling from the trees
G      F                C               Am
One by one my hopes are vanished in the clouds clear
G      Em                  C              G
One by one like snowflakes melting in the breeze

Am            C
One by one my hair is turning gray
G                        F           Em
One by one my dreams are fading fast away
Am           C
One by one I read your letters over
G      F     C            G
One by one I lay them all away

G      F                C           Am
One by one the days are slipping up behind you
G      F                C               Am
One by one the sweetest days of life go by
G      F               C             Am
One by one the moments stealing up behind you
G      F                   C               G
One by one she'll come and find not you or I

G      F              C                   Am
One by one I hear the soft words that you whispered
G      F               C               Am
One by one I feel your kisses soft and sweet
G      F                 C                Am
One by one I hope you'll say the words to marry
G      Em            C           G
One by one to one by one forever be
