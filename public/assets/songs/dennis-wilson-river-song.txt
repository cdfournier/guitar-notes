Walking down by the river
A     D                  A    D
Water running through my knees
A        D              A    D
River oh river moves so free
A         D     A       D
Oh mighty river endlessly

Has not got the time to say

D     A             D
I was born into the city life
D    A                  D
It's all that I've ever known
D   A                                  D
You know it's rough getting round this place
D  A                    D
So crowded I can hardly breathe
D       A                D
You can only see about a block or two
D  A             D
In LA that's the truth
D   A                D
I'm looking for some country life
D    A                    D
Some kicking room no more city life
D          A             D
I want the river

A       D                  A     D
Rolling rolling rolling on river
(I got to get away I got to get away I got to get away)
A       D                  A     D
Rolling rolling rolling on river
(I got to get away I got to get away I got to get away)
A       D                  A     D
Rolling rolling rolling on river
(I got to get away I got to get away I got to get away)
A       D                  A     D
Rolling rolling rolling on river
(I got to get away I got to get away I got to get away)
A       D                  A     D
Rolling rolling rolling on river

It breaks my heart to see the city
  D                   A
I wonder why it ain't pretty
A            F#m         E   D
Oh I want to cry want to cry

D                     A           D
Come on you've got to do it do it do it
D          A                   D
You got to run away you got to run away
