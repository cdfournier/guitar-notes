Laying in our clearing we're limb by limb
G                                  F                  C
You built me in one morning in the leaves around your skin
C               G
I hear rainfall on the palm
G                     F    C
Of the hand that will hold mine
C     D             F
And I listen yeah I listen
F    G
Yeah I just lay there with her and listen

F    G    C    Am   F   G    C    Am
Drop down afternoon drifting afternoon
F    G    F    G    C
Afternoon afternoon spray

Am             C      G
Drop on my old lady's face
Am             C      G
Drop on my old lady's waist
G   F G    F            G       C
And I drop drop into my woman's arms

Nothing has to live forever

Nothing has to hold together

Nothing has to be remembered all the way
C                   G
But I see rain fall on the face
G                          F     C
Of the only woman who ever loved me
C     D             F
And I listen yeah I listen
