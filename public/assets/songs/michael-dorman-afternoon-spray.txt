Laying in our clearing we're limb by limb
G                                  F                  C
You built me in one morning in the leaves around your skin
C               G
I hear rainfall on the palm
G                     F    C
Of the hand that will hold mine
C     D             F
And I listen yeah I listen
F    G
Yeah I just lay there with her and listen

F    G    C    Am   F   G    C    Am
Drop down afternoon drifting afternoon
F    G    F    G    C
Afternoon afternoon spray

Am                     C
Drop on my old lady's face
Am                    C
Drop on my old lady's waist
G   F G    F            G       C
And I drop drop into my woman's arms

Nothing has to live forever

Nothing has to hold together
G                            F       C
Nothing has to be remembered all the way
C                   G
But I see rain fall on the face
G                          F     C
Of the only woman who ever loved me
C     D             F
And I listen yeah I listen

Drop down afternoon drifting afternoon

My boss Leslie is like your grandfather
G
That you like less than your other grandfather
G
He's kind of a prick and says things like
F              C
Keep your hair cut
C
But he just cares about things you should care about
G
Like doing your work right and showing up on time
G                     F         C
Keeping your word and old world craftsmanship

C        D          F
And he's probably a better man
F    G
Than your more casual grandpa

F    G    C   Am
Here's to old school
F G     C      Am
I think you're grandpa number one
F   G      F         G        C
And I just wanted to tell you now
F    G    F        G           C
That I'll probably mess you up somehow anyway
D
Later
