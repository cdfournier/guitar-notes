Bells ring into the night
Sounds like a mistress on a rainy night
Hold your throat and arms together
And see the light that goes away

Leave my heart down by the water
He spins inside my soul
It isn't true but you follow
Just hold me down by the water

They say you look like a believer
Look up to see the weakness in the sky
Nobody's out to buy your story
Nobody wants to know your reason why

Hold your hands out towards the water
In front of me to know I'm with you
Don't put it all into your hero
Look on if you believe
Look on if you believe
Look on if you believe

Don't want to say that I'm through with it
Just want to be right by your side
Right by your side
