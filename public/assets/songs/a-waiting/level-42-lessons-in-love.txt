G       D           Em
I'm not proud I was wrong
        C                G
And the truth is hard to take
       D           Em
I felt sure we had enough
        C         G
But our love went overboard
         D            Em
Lifeboat lies lost at sea
          C                    G
I've been trying to reach your shore
         D                   Em D
Waves of doubt keep drowning me

        C                   Am      D
All the dreams that we were building
         Em
We never fulfilled them
         C                Am    D
Could be better should be better
               Em  D
For lessons in love

G            D         Em
For restless eyes egos burn
        C               G
And the mold is hard to break
          D            Em
Now we've waded in too deep
    C       G
And love is overboard
      D            Em
Heavy hearts token words
        C            G
All the hopes I ever had
     D                      Em   D
Fade like footprints in the sand

        C                  Am      D
All the homes that we were building
         Em
We never lived in
         C                Am    D
Could be better should be better
           Em  D
Lessons in love

      C             Am        D
If we lose the time before us
           Em
The future will ignore us
          C               Am         D
We should use it we could use it yeah
           Em  D  C
Lessons in love
             Em  D C
Lost without love

Lessons in love
When will you ever learn
Lessons in love
When there's nowhere left to turn

Lessons in love
Don't let your spirit burn
Lessons in love
I'll wait til you return

All the dreams that we were building yeah yeah yeah
We never lived them
We could lose it we should use it
Lessons in love

All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better should be better
Lessons in love

If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it we could use it
Lessons in love
