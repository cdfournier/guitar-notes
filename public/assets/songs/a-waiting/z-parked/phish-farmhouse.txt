Welcome this is a farmhouse
We have cluster flies alas
And this time of year is bad
We are so very sorry
There is little we can do but swat them

She didn't beg oh not enough
She didn't stay when things got tough
I told a lie and she got mad
She wasn't there when things got bad

I never ever saw the Northern lights
I never really heard of cluster flies
I never ever saw the stars so bright
In the farmhouse things will be alright

I never ever saw the Northern lights
I never really heard of cluster flies
I never ever saw the stars so bright
In the farmhouse things will be alright
Alright alright alright alright alright

Woke this morning to the stinging lash
Every man rise from the ash
Each betrayal begins with trust
Every man returns to dust

I never ever saw the Northern lights
I never really heard of cluster flies
I never ever saw the stars so bright
In the farmhouse things will be alright

I never ever saw the Northern lights
I never really heard of cluster flies
I never ever saw the stars so bright
In the farmhouse things will be alright

I never ever saw the Northern lights
I never really heard of cluster flies
I never ever saw the stars so bright
In the farmhouse things will be alright

I never ever saw the Northern lights
I never really heard of cluster flies
I never ever saw the stars so bright
In the farmhouse things will be alright
Alright alright alright alright alright

Welcome this is a farmhouse
Welcome this is a farmhouse

I never ever saw the Northern lights
I never really heard of cluster flies
I never ever saw the stars so bright
In the farmhouse things will be alright
