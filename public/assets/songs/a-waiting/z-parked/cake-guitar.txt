I'm sitting by the window of your 32nd floor apartment
Waiting for your phone calls all to end
I'm sitting watching wind blow
Watching time go watching cars go by
I'm waiting for these memories to begin

If I threw my guitar
Out the window so far down
Would I start to regret it
Or would I smile
And watch it slowly fall fall fall

Garbage trucks and taxi cabs
Don't seem like they can reach me here
The clamor of jackhammers seems so faint
Well the way you treat me
Like the only slightly brings me down a lot
I don't think that I'll ever be the same yeah

If I threw my guitar
Out the window so far down
Would I start to regret it
Or would I smile
And watch it slowly fall fall fall
Fall fall fall
Fall fall fall
Fall fall fall
