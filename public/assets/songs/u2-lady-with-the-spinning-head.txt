Figure of eight six and nine again

    Lady with the spinning head

Whatever the deal she won't let me down

Wherever I go she's always hanging round

A D E
    Lady with the spinning head
A D E
    Lady with the spinning head
A D E
    Lady with the spinning head

She's been gone but I knew she'd be back
E
She's got the rent she put me in the black

    Lady with the spinning head

A            D
Mean old man took away my car
E                         D
Those credit guys they've got the power
A               D
I'm on top when she's around
E               A
She's my ticket out of town

A D E
    Lady with the spinning head
A D E
    Lady with the spinning head
