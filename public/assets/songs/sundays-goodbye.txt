G A D

D    G             A           D
Oh I vow that it's goodbye
D    G             A           D
Oh I vow that it's goodbye and God bless
G                   A
Why did we have to assume
A     D
We're exactly the same
D     G                    A             D
Oh no no talking about yourself self self

D    G             A              D
Oh I vow that it's goodbye to the old ways
D     G              A
Those stories were a good read
A         D
They were dumb as well
G                A
I could never be seen
A       D                G
Falling down on my knees crawling
G                     A             D
Oh no no talk about a sell sell sell

D G A      D
    It's unfair
D G A      D
    It's unfair
D G A      D
    It's unfair

D  G
Oh as the heavens shudder baby
A              D
I belong to you
D       G
Oh they said you get what you deserve
G   A                    D
And all they said was true

D     G                   A
So is this what it's come to
A    Bm                        D
Am I cold or just a little bit warm
D  G
Oh well
G                    A                   D
Just give me an easy life and a peaceful death
D G A D
    Yeah yeah
