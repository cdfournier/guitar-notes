D Am C Em D

D               Am
I I'm a one way motorway
Am               C
I'm the one that drives away
     Em               D
Then follows you back home

D                    Am
I I'm a street light shining
Am               C
I'm a wild light blinding bright
Em              D
Burning off and on

     C                    G             D
It's times like these you learn to live again
     C                    Em            D
It's times like these you give and give again
     C                    G             D
It's times like these you learn to love again
     C                Em            D
It's times like these time and time again

D               Am
I I'm a new day rising
Am              C
I'm a brand new sky
   Em                  D
To hang the stars upon tonight

D             Am
I am a little divided
Am           C
Do I stay or run away
    Em           D
And leave it all behind

     C                    G             D
It's times like these you learn to live again
     C                    Em            D
It's times like these you give and give again
     C                    G             D
It's times like these you learn to love again
     C                Em            D
It's times like these time and time again

     C                    G             D
It's times like these you learn to live again
     C                    Em            D
It's times like these you give and give again
     C                    G             D
It's times like these you learn to love again
     C                Em            D
It's times like these time and time again

     C                    G             D
It's times like these you learn to live again
     C                    Em            D
It's times like these you give and give again
     C                    G             D
It's times like these you learn to love again
     C                Em            D
It's times like these time and time again
