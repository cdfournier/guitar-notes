D C G Em Am

D       C                 G       D
I gotta tell you what I'm feeling inside
Em      D        C
I could lie to myself but it's true
D          C       G                   D
There's no denying when I look in your eyes
Em              D       C
Girl I'm out of my head over you

Am             G              C           D
And I lived so long believing all love is blind
G              C            D
But everything about you is telling me this time

     G  D    Em          C
It's forever this time I know
               Am
And there's no doubt in my mind
   D    G        D       Am
Forever until my life is through
G            C                 D C
Girl I'll be loving you forever

D          C         G         D
I hear the echo of a promise I made
Em                         D             C
When you're strong you can stand on your own
D                C            G            D
Those words grow distant as I look at your face
Em               D     C
No I don't wanna go it alone

Am          G                  C            D
And I never thought I'd lay my heart on the line
G              C            D
But everything about you is telling me this time

     G  D    Em          C
It's forever this time I know
               Am
And there's no doubt in my mind
   D    G        D       Am
Forever until my life is through
G            C                 D C
Girl I'll be loving you forever

D C G D Em D C

Am       G             C            D
I see my future when I look in your eyes
Am      G                    C          D
It took your love to make my heart come alive
Am               G              C           D
Cause I lived my life believing all love is blind
G              C            D
But everything about you is telling me this time

     G  D    Em          C
It's forever this time I know
               Am
And there's no doubt in my mind
   D    G        D       Am
Forever until my life is through
G            C                 D C
Girl I'll be loving you forever oh

     G  D    Em          C
It's forever this time I know
               Am
And there's no doubt in my mind
   D    G        D       Am
Forever until my life is through
G            C                 D C
Girl I'll be loving you forever
