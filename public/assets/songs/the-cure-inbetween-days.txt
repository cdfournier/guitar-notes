Yesterday I got so old
A             D
I felt like I could die
A           D      A
Yesterday I got so old
A                  A
It made me want to cry

Go on go on just walk away

Go on go on your choice is made

Go on go on and disappear
A           D
Go on go on away from here

And I know I was wrong
Bm     E
When I said it was true
E       Bm                    E
That it couldn't be me and be her
E                  A   D
In between without you
A          D
Without you

A           D
Yesterday I got so scared
A                 D
I shivered like a child
A         D
Yesterday away from you
A                D
It froze me deep inside

A                   D
Come back come back don't walk away
A                   D
Come back come back come back today
A                   D
Come back come back what can't you see
A                        D
Come back come back come back to me
