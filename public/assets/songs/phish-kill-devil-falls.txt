C                  G
Just got back from Kill Devil Falls
G                     C
Draped my waterlogged clothes in the hall
C                G
Reach for a beer glad that I'm here
G                              C
When I realize that you're not around

C                        G
Turned on some music and then the TV
G                           C
Go through the pile of mail waiting for me
C                        G
Something I spy makes me pull it aside
G                       C
A letter from your home town

F                          C
How could you leave me you heard what I said
G                       C
I'd be at the waterfall clearing my head
F                     C
Soaking up nature and thinking of you
G                              C
But leaving's the last thing I thought you would do

F                C
I didn't plan to stop at the bar
C   G                   C
But Kill Devil Falls is really so far
F                                C
Who knew a day would turn into a week
G
But I learned my lesson
G
And I can still remember the last one
G
But this time will be different
G             C
Until I do it again

C             G
Stared at the ceiling for over a day
G                            C
But none of my questions are answered this way
C                           G
Won't make any calls I just bounce off the walls
G                           C
Til I go back to Kill Devil Falls

F                          C
How could you leave me you heard what I said
G                       C
I'd be at the waterfall clearing my head
F                     C
Soaking up nature and thinking of you
G
And leaving's the last thing I thought you would do

F                C
I didn't plan to stop at the bar
C   G                   C
But Kill Devil Falls is really so far
F                                C
Who knew a day would turn into a week
G
But I learned my lesson
G
And I can still remember the last one
G
But this time will be different
G
This time will be different

F                              C       G
And I stand at the base of the mountain (don't follow me)
F                          C         G
And I step right up to the cliff side (gotta learn how to lead)
F                             C     G
And I stare straight into the future (tell me what do you see)
F                    C        G
This time's gonna be different

F C G
Whoa  don't go back to Kill Devil Falls
F C G
Whoa  don't go back to Kill Devil Falls
F C G
Whoa  don't go back to Kill Devil Falls
G
I learned my lesson
G
And I can still remember the last one
G
But this time will be different

Don't go back to Kill Devil Falls
Don't go back to Kill Devil Falls
Don't go back to Kill Devil Falls
Don't go back to Kill Devil Falls
Don't go back to Kill Devil Falls
Don't go back to Kill Devil Falls
Don't go back to Kill Devil Falls
Don't go back to Kill Devil Falls
