On the corner carolers are singing

Christmas Eve and all the world is watching

Santa guides his reindeer through the dark
G               E            D         Bm
From rooftop to chimney from Harlem to Bimini

D                G              D
Just outside the window snow is falling
D                   Bm                Em
But here beside the fire we share the glow
G                E            D        Bm
Of moonlight and brandy sweet talk and candy
Em                              A
Sentiments that everyone should know

So when spirits grow lighter

And hopes are shining brighter
Em                 A                 D
Then you know that Christmas time is here
