C        G
It's the kind of night that's so cold
G        C                 G
When you spit it freezes before it hits the ground
G                                            C
And when a bum asks for a quarter you give a dollar
C                      D
If he's out tonight he must be truly down

D       C
And I'm searching all the windows for a last-minute present
C               Am
To prove to you what I said was real
Am  D                                     C
For something small and frail and plastic baby
C                    G
Cause cheap is how I feel

G
Half moon in the sky tonight
C                G
Bright enough to come up with an answer
G                                               C
To the question why is it that every time I see you
C       G
My love grows a little stronger

G        C
But your memory leaves my stomach churning
C                   D
Feeling like a liar about to be revealed
D        Am                C
But I'll hoard all this to myself
C                    G
Cause cheap is how I feel

G
It's not the smell in here that gets to me
G        C                 G
It's the lights I hate the shadows that they cast
G                                        C
And the sound of clinking bottles is the one sure thing
C                     D
I'll always drag with me from my past

D            C
I think I'll find a pair of eyes tonight to fall into
C   Am
And maybe strike a deal
Am   D                     C
Your body for my soul fair swap
C                    G
Cause cheap is how I feel
