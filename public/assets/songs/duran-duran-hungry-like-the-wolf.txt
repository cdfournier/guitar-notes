E - D

E
Dark in the city night is a wire
Steam in the subway earth is a afire

      D                                    E
Do do do  do do do  do do do  do do do do  do do

E
Woman you want me give me a sign
And catch my breathing even closer behind

      D                                    E
Do do do  do do do  do do do  do do do do  do do

C                 G
In touch with the ground
G          F
I'm on the hunt I'm after you
F            C                   G
Smell like I sound I'm lost in a crowd
G       F               D
And I'm hungry like the wolf

D            C                   G
Straddle the line in discord and rhyme
G          F
I'm on the hunt I'm after you
F        C                      G
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
G       F               D   Em
And I'm hungry like the wolf

E
Stalked in the forest too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side

      D                                    E
Do do do  do do do  do do do  do do do do  do do

E
High blood drumming on your skin it's so tight
You feel my heat I'm just a moment behind

      D                                    E
Do do do  do do do  do do do  do do do do  do do

In touch with the ground
G          F
I'm on the hunt I'm after you
F             C                      G
A scent and a sound I'm lost and I'm found
G       F               D
And I'm hungry like the wolf

D          C                     G
Strut on a line it's discord and rhyme
G            F
I howl and I whine I'm after you
F        D                 G
Mouth is alive all running inside
G       F               D   Em
And I'm hungry like the wolf

C                                   G
Burning the ground I break from the crowd
G          F
I'm on the hunt I'm after you
F              C                      G
