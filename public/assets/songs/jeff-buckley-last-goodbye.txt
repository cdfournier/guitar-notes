This is our last goodbye
D         Bm            A          Em
I hate to feel the love between us die
Em       G
But it's over
G         D
Just hear this and then I'll go
    A
You gave me more to live for
G                     D
More than you'll ever know

D
This is our last embrace
D      Bm               A        G
Must I dream and always see your face
    Em                     D
Why can't we overcome this wall
A
Baby maybe its just because
A          G
You didn't know you at all

C

A              G
Kiss me please kiss me
G           A                      G
But kiss me out of desire babe not consolation
G      A
Oh you know it makes me so angry
A       G
Cause I know that in time
A                  G
I'll only make you cry
G                    D
This is our last goodbye

D
Oh oh oh
D
Ooh ooh ooh

D       Bm  A             G
Did you say no this can't happen to me
D       Bm          A        G
Did you rush to the phone to call
G           D       Bm          A            G
Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind
G      Em Bm A  G          Em
Saying may   be you didn't know him at all
Em         G                                A
You didn't know him at all oh oh you didn't know
C G D          A    C G D
    Ooh didn't know

D
Well the bells out in the church tower chime
D
Burning clues into this heart of mine
D
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes
D                                       C
And the memories of her sighs that it's over
C    D    F#m G C
It's over
