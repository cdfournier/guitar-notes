G Em A C

G           Em
I live on a chain
A             C
You share the same last name
     G                       Em
As a joke I sent a bottle of whiskey
       A                         C
As you choked I knew it made you feel dirty

      D
I was waiting over here
            Am
For life to begin
                      Em
I was looking for the new thing
                 C
And you were the sunshine
           A7
Heading my frontline
      C
I was alone
                         D           G
You were just around the corner from me

G
Time alone is good
                       Em
I spend my days in the city
A
Dirty neighborhood
                      C
You know you'll never convince me
     G
So I sold the town away
                   Em
I couldn't wait to forget you
      A
I was killed in half a day
                 C
I hadn't time to regret you

      D
I was waiting over here
            Am
For life to begin
                      Em
I was looking for the new thing
                 C
And you were the sunshine
           A7
Heading my frontline
      C
I was alone
                         D           G
You were just around the corner from me
