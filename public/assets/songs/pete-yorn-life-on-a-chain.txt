I live on a chain
You share the same last name
As a joke
I sent a bottle of whiskey
As you choked i knew
It made you feel dirty

I was waiting over here
For life to begin
I was looking for the new thing
And you were the sunshine
Heading my frontline
I was alone
You were just around the corner from me

Time alone is good
I spend my days in the city
Dirty neighborhood
You know you'll never convince me
So I sold the town away
I couldn't wait to forget you
I was killed in half a day
I hadn't time to regret you

I was waiting over here
For life to begin
I was looking for the new thing
And you were the sunshine
Heading my frontline
I was alone
You were just around the corner from me

I live on chain
You share the same last name
As a joke
I sent a bottle of whiskey
As you choked i knew
It made you feel dirty

Waiting over here
For life to begin
I was looking for the new thing
You were the sunshine
Heading my frontline
I was alone
And you were just around
The corner from me

You were the sunshine
Heading my frontline
Just around the corner from me
Yeah you were
You were the sunshine
Heading my frontline
Just around the corner
From me
Just around the corner
From me
