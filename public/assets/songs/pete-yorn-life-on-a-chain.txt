G           Em
I live on a chain
A             C
You share the same last name
C    G                       Em
As a joke I sent a bottle of whiskey
Em     A                         C
As you choked I knew it made you feel dirty

C     D
I was waiting over here
D           Am
For life to begin
Am                    Em
I was looking for the new thing
Em               C
And you were the sunshine
C          A7
Heading my frontline
A7    C
I was alone
C                        D           G
You were just around the corner from me

G
Time alone is good
G                      Em
I spend my days in the city
A
Dirty neighborhood
A                     C
You know you'll never convince me
C    G
So I sold the town away
G                  Em
I couldn't wait to forget you
Em    A
I was killed in half a day
A                C
I hadn't time to regret you

C     D
I was waiting over here
D           Am
For life to begin
Am                    Em
I was looking for the new thing
Em               C
And you were the sunshine
C          A7
Heading my frontline
A7    C
I was alone
C                        D           G
