D                              A
Well it's been ten years and a thousand tears
G                        D
And look at the mess I'm in
D                   A
A broken nose and a broken heart
G                  D
An empty bottle of gin
D                A
Well I sit and I pray
G                 D
In my broken down Chevrolet
D                    A
While I'm singing to myself
G                         D
There's got to be another way

D              A
Take away take away
G                       D
Take away this ball and chain
D                  A
I'm lonely and I'm tired
G                         D
And I can't take any more pain
D              A
Take away take away
G               D
Never to return again
D              A
Take away take away
G                            D
Take away this ball and chain

D                           A
Well I've searched and I've searched
G                   D
To find the perfect life
D                               A
A brand new car and a brand new suit
G                      D
I even got me a little wife
D                   A
But wherever I have gone
G                         D
I was sure to find myself there
D                    A
You can run all your life
G          D
But not go anywhere

D              A
Take away take away
G                       D
Take away this ball and chain
D                     A
Well I'm sick and I'm tired
G                         D
And I can't take any more pain
D              A
Take away take away
G               D
Never to return again
D              A
Take away take away
G                            D
Take away this ball and chain

D                          A
Well I pass the bar on the way
G                 D
To my dingy hotel room
D              A
I spent all my money
G                                 D
I been drinking since a half past noon
D                      A
I'll wake there in the morning
G                      D
Or maybe in the county jail
D                      A
Times are hard getting harder
G                                D
I'm born to lose and destined to fail

D              A
Take away take away
G                       D
Take away this ball and chain
D                  A
I'm lonely and I'm tired
G                         D
And I can't take any more pain
D              A
Take away take away
G               D
Never to return again
D              A
Take away take away
G                            D
Take away this ball and chain
