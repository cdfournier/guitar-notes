A D E

A                D              E
Suicide standing sucking in her cheeks
A
Too much lips and too much eyes
D                E
Hasn't slept for weeks
D         E    D             E
She don't know just where it goes

Jackie T said she saw death
D                   E
She's done it fifty ways
A
But she's been off that medicine for
D              E
Almost fifteen days
D         E    D             E
She don't know just where it goes

So turn around and run
A                 D
Back where you're from
D             E
You can't get on
E                 A
Don't shake those hips
A                D
Don't bite those lips
D            E
Just keep it hid

A
Come on now you gave it away
    D                   E
And all the friends you had got paid
A
Come on now you were never that shy
    D                 E              A
And that's no way for you to say bye bye

Baby you drive me crazy
      E                   A
Don't come around here no more
