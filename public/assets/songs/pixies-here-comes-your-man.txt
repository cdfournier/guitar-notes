D                 A
Outside there's a box car waiting
Em          G
Outside the family stew
D          A
Out by the fire breathing
Em         G
Outside we wait till face turns blue

D          A
I know the nervous walking
Em         G
I know the dirty beard hangs
D          A
Out by the box car waiting
Em              G
Take me away to nowhere plains

Bm                 G
There is a wait so long
G           A
(So long so long)
A                    D
You'll never wait so long

G A               D
  Here comes your man
G A               D
  Here comes your man
G A               D
  Here comes your man

D                    A
Big shake on the box car moving
Em               G                   D
Big shake to the land that's falling down
D                 A
Is a wind makes a palm stop blowing
Em              G                 D
A big big stone fall and break my crown

Bm                 G
There is a wait so long
G           A
(So long so long)
A                    D
You'll never wait so long

G A               D
  Here comes your man
G A               D
  Here comes your man
G A               D
  Here comes your man

  Here comes your man
