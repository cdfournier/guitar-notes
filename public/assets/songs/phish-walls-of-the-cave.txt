Am                F
I'm leaving you a message
F   G             Am
I'm leaving you a trace
Am                       F
I'm leaving thoughts for you
F           G             Am
I hope that time will not erase
Am                  F
And when the moment comes
F           G              C
To read the words that I engrave
F                       G            Am
You'll find them on the walls of the cave
Am G C D      Am  G C D
       Of the cave

D                    C
I know you heard the question
C       G             D
But you didn't make a sound
D                    Em
And when it fell you caught my heart
G                 D
Before it hit the ground
D               Em
But if you ever need the names
   G                  D
Of those you couldn't save
F                       G            C
You'll find them on the walls of the cave
F                       G            C
You'll find them on the walls of the cave

C       G
Look at me
    Am          F
The time stands still
C            G    Am          F
The mountain here    is now a hill
F    G    F    Em    G
Look away

C    G
Look away
    Am        F
The time goes past
C                G    Am         F
These rocks will fall    away at last
F    G    F    Em    D
Look away

F              C
Maybe you will see it
C         G
As you're passing by alone
F                 C
Below the moss forgotten
C          G
Where some words adorn a stone
Am                    Em
It might have been an etching
Em   F
On a marker of a grave
   G            F            C
Or maybe on the walls of the cave

Listen to the silent trees
But still your words float on the breeze

C        G  Am   F
Look away
F          C        G  Am  F
I see them all
C          G  Am  F            C        G  Am  F
Carved into         the cavern wall

C        G  Am  F
Listen to
F          C        G  Am  F
The silent trees
F   C               G  Am  F
But still your words
F            C      G  Am  F
Float on the breeze

C        G  Am   F
Look away
F          C        G  Am  F
I see them all
C          G  Am  F            C        G  Am  F
Carved into         the cavern wall

C        G  Am  F
Listen to
F          C        G  Am  F
The silent trees
