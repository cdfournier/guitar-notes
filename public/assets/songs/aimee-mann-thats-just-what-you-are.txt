G Em Bm D - G Em Bm D

G        Em            Bm           D      G
In our endeavor we are never seeing eye to eye
G          Em          Bm          D       G
No guts to sever so forever may we wave goodbye
G          Em             Bm              D       G
And you're always telling me that it's my turn to move
G      Em                Bm              D        C
When I wonder what could make the needle jump the groove

C       G            Am     Em           C
I won't fall for the oldest trick in the book
C        G             Am    Em                C
So don't sit there and think you're off of the hook
C     G            Am     Em      
By saying there is no use changing cause

Am          C    G   F
That's just what you are
Am          C    G   F
That's just what you are

G      Em            Bm         D         G
Acting steady always ready to defend your fears
G          Em              Bm          D           G
What's the matter with the truth did I offend your ears
G        Em          Bm                D        G
By suggesting that a change might be a thing to try
G             Em               Bm           D     C
Like it would kill you just to try and be a nicer guy

C        G              Am   Em            C
It's not like you would lose some critical piece
C      G             Am    Em         C
If somehow you moved point A to point B
C      G             Am       Em        
Maintaining there is no point changing cause

Am          C    G   F
That's just what you are
Am          C    G   F
That's just what you are

Em                      C       A
Now I could talk to you til I'm blue in the face
Em                   C           A
But we still would arrive at the very same place
Em               C             A          C
With you running around and me out of the race

G Em Bm D - G Em Bm D - G Em Bm D - G Em Bm D

C  G            Am    Em         C
So maybe you're right nobody can take
C   G                Am       Em             C
Something older than time and hope you could make
C  G           Am    Em      C
It better that would be a mistake
C  G            Am Em  D
So take it just so far

C     Am          C    G   F
Cause that's just what you are
Am          C    G   F
That's just what you are
Am          C    G   F
That's just what you are

G      Em            Bm         D         G
Acting steady always ready to defend your fears
G      Em                  Bm          D           G
What's the matter with the truth did I offend your ears
