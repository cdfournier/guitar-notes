Bm             D
In the dark of night
Bm          D
Those small hours
Em            F#
Uncertain and anxious
F#        Bm
I need to call you

Bm            D
Rooms full of strangers
Bm            D
Some call me friend

So close to me

In the dark of night
Bm          D
Those small hours
Em
I drift away

When I'm with you

Here comes the clown
Bm            D
His face is a wall
Em
No window
   F#     Bm
No air at all

Bm             D
In the dark of night

Those faces they haunt me
Em
But I wish you were

So close to me
