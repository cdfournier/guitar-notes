Well I thought about the army
D        Am
Dad said son you're fucking high
Am    G
And I thought yeah
G                        D
There's a first for everything

D
So I took my old man's advice
D
Three sad semesters
D      Am                     G
It was only 15 grand spent in bed
G
I thought about the army
D                          Bm
I dropped out and joined a band instead

Am Em D - Am Em D

D
Grew a mustache and a mullet
D     Am
Got a job at Chick-Fil-A
Am     G
Citing artistic differences
G   D
The band broke up in May

D      Bm
And in June reformed without me
Bm       Am
And they got a different name
Am      G
I nuked another grandma's apple pie
G   D               Bm
And hung my head in shame oh

Am Em D                    Am        Em D
      I've been thinking a lot today
D                    Am        Em D
I've been thinking a lot today

C  G                      D
Oh   I think I'll write a screenplay
C  G                         D
Oh   I think I'll take it to LA
C  G                          D
Oh   I think I'll get it done yesterday

Bm      D
In this time of introspection
D      Am
On the eve of my election
  G
I say to my reflection
G          D
God please spare me more rejection

D        Bm
Cause my peers they criticize me
Bm     Am
And my ex-wives all despise me
Am     G
Try to put it all behind me
G      D               Bm
But my redneck past is nipping at my heels

Am Em D                    Am        Em D
      I've been thinking a lot today
D                    Am        Em D
I've been thinking a lot today
D                    Am        Em D
I've been thinking a lot today
D         Am   Em    D
I thought about  the army
