Some folks are born made to wave the flag
C                     G
They're red white and blue
G                       F
And when the band plays Hail to the Chief
C                        G
They point the cannon at you

G           D
It ain't me it ain't me
C                        G
I ain't no millionaire's son
G           D
It ain't me it ain't me
C                    G
I ain't no fortunate one

G                   F
Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
C                    G
Lord don't they help themselves
G                   F
But when the taxman comes to the door
C                               G
The house look a like a rummage sale

G           D
It ain't me it ain't me
C                    G
I ain't no senator's son
G           D
It ain't me it ain't me
C                    G
I ain't no fortunate one

Some folks inherit star-spangled eyes
C                     G
They send you down to war
G                   F
And when you ask em how much should we give
C                G
They only answer more more more

G           D
It ain't me it ain't me
C                   G
I ain't no military son
G           D
It ain't me it ain't me
C                    G
I ain't no fortunate one

G           D
It ain't me it ain't me
C                    G
I ain't no fortunate one

It ain't me it ain't me

I ain't no fortunate one
