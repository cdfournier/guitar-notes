G       D                C         G
I'm not together and you know it's true
   C        D             G
My bits all wander in the trees
G        D           C      G
And if I ever seem a little strange
C         D         C
Would you excuse me please

I said I'm human but you know I lie
    C    D             G
I'm only visiting this shore
G            D              C        G
I'll soon be leaving in the outbound tide
C      D             C
I pray again we will meet

G   D            C         G          C
I'm wasting your time just talking to you
      D        G     Em
Maybe best you go on home
G    D         C     G              C
I'll leave you alone fade from your mind
D             G          Em
Slip into the greens and blues
