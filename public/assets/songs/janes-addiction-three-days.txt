Three days was the morning
My focus three days old
My head it landed
To the sounds of cricket bows

Covered now by three days

Three ways was the morning
Three lovers in three ways
We knew when she landed
Three days she'd stay

I am a proud man anyway
Covered now by three days

We saw shadows of the morning light
E              A
Shadows of the evening sun

Til the shadows and the light were one

Til the shadows and the light were one
