Em                    C
On the roller coaster ride
D                        C
That my emotions have to take me on
Em                     C
I heard a newborn baby cry
C           D    C
Through the night

Em                     C
I heard a perfect echo die
D                         C
Into an anonymous wall of digital sound
Em             C
Somewhere deep inside
C     D   C
Of my soul

G                       C  D                G           C D
A natural beauty should be preserved like a monument to nature
G                                 C
Don't judge yourself too harsh my love
   D                           G    C    D
Or someday you might find your soul endangered
G                       C  D                G           C D

Em    C
Amazon
D                          C
You had so much and now so much is gone
Em           C
What are you gonna do
C         D   C
With your life

Em           C
What a lucky man
D                          C
To see the earth before it touched his hand
Em            C
What an angry fool
C  D      C
To condemn

Em                C
One more night to go
D                        C
One more sleep upon your burning banks
Em                 C
A greedy man never knows
C         D    C
What he's done

Em                C
Went to the rodeo today
D                           C
I saw the cowgirls lined up on the fence
Em                C
A brand new Chevrolet
D                            C
A brand new pair of seamless pants

Em                       C
We watched the moment of defeat
D                       C
Played back over on the video screen
Em             C
Somewhere deep inside
C     D   C
Of my soul
