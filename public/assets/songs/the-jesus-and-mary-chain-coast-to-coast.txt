Feels like something's pumping through my veins
G                                      D
I got the junk gun fever sinking to my brain
C                 G             D
Feels like God in Heaven's gone insane

I got a cat scratch engine takes me on the road
G                                      D
Wheels get rolling back to the world I know
C                G            D
Takes me just as far as I can go

D
I got my senses strung out to the sky
G                                      D
And that desert city's got me reaching high
C           G          D
Here I come here I come

Hip shake gunning kick start and I'm running
