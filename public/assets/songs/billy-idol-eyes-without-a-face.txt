D             Bm
I'm so out of hope
Bm           F#m
One more bad break
F#m         A
And I might fall
D                 Bm
When I'm far from home
Bm                   F#m
Don't call me on the phone
F#m               A
To tell me you're alone
     D       Bm
It's easy to deceive
Bm      F#m
Easy to tease
F#m             A
But hard to get release

(Les yeux sans visage)
A              Em
Eyes without a face
Em                F#m
They got no human grace
F#m                    D
They're eyes without a face

D Bm F#m A

D              Bm
I spend all my time
Bm                F#m
Believing all the lies
F#m               A
To keep my dreams alive
D               Bm
Yes it makes me sad
Bm                   F#m
It'd make you mad at truth
F#m                 A
For loving what was you

G              A
(Les yeux sans visage)

Eyes without a face
Em                F#m
They got no human grace
F#m                    D
They're eyes without a face

D Bm F#m A

When you hear the music you make a dip
Into someone else's pocket and then make a slip
You steal a car and go to Las Vegas
Ooh the gigolo pool
Hanging out by the state line
Turning holy water into wine
Then you drink it down
I'm on this bus on a psychedelic trip
I'm reading murder books trying to stay hip
And I'm I think of you and you're out there so
Say your prayers

D Bm F#m A

D              Bm
Now I close my eyes
Bm           F#m
Yes I wonder why
F#m     A
I don't despise
D             Bm
Now all I can do
Bm               F#m
Is love what was once
F#m          A
So alive and new
A                        F#m
When it's gone from your eyes
F#m           A
I'd better realize

G              A
(Les yeux sans visage)
A              G
Eyes without a face
G              A

Eyes without a face

They got no human grace

They're eyes without a face
