D Bm F#m A

D             Bm
I'm so out of hope
Bm           F#m
One more bad break
F#m         A
And I might fall
D                 Bm
When I'm far from home
Bm                   F#m
Don't call me on the phone
F#m               A
To tell me you're alone
     D       Bm
It's easy to deceive
Bm      F#m
Easy to tease
F#m             A
But hard to get release

G              A

A              Em
Eyes without a face
Em                F#m
They got no human grace
F#m                    D
They're eyes without a face

D Bm F#m A

D              Bm
I spend all my time
Bm                F#m
Believing all the lies
F#m               A
To keep my dreams alive
D               Bm
Yes it makes me sad
Bm                   F#m
It'd make you mad at truth
F#m                 A
For loving what was you

They're eyes without a face

F G - F G

F
When you hear the music you make a dip
G
Into someone else's pocket and then make a slip
F
You steal a car and go to Las Vegas
G
Ooh the gigolo pool
F
Hanging out by the state line
G
Turning holy water into wine
F                     G
Then you drink it down

F
I'm on this bus on a psychedelic trip
G
I'm reading murder books trying to stay hip
F
And I'm I think of you and you're out there so
G               F               G
Say your prayers

D Bm F#m A

D              Bm
Now I close my eyes
Bm           F#m
Yes I wonder why
F#m     A
I don't despise
D             Bm
Now all I can do
Bm               F#m
Is love what was once
F#m          A
So alive and new
A                        F#m
When it's gone from your eyes
F#m           A
I'd better realize

They're eyes without a face
