Am                                    D    G
I don't know what it is that makes me feel alive
Am                                       D     G
I don't know how to wake the things that sleep inside
Am                              D      G      Am   D
I only wanna see the light that shines behind your eyes

Am                                 D        G
I hope that I can say the things I wish I'd said
Am                                   D       G
To sing my soul to sleep and take me back to bed
Am                                D    G     Am
Who wants to be alone when we can feel alive instead

Because we need each other

We believe in one another

What's sleeping in our soul
Because we need each other
We believe in one another
I know we're going to uncover
What's sleeping in our soul
What's sleeping in our soul

There are many things that I would like to know
And there are many places that I wish to go
But everything's depending on the way the wind may blow

I don't know what it is that makes me feel alive
I don't know how to wake the things that sleep inside
I only want to see the light that shines behind your eyes

Because we need each other
We believe in one another
And I know we're going to uncover
What's sleeping in our soul
Because we need each other
We believe in one another
I know we're going to uncover
What's sleeping in our soul
What's sleeping in our soul

What's sleeping in our soul
What's sleeping in our soul
Sleeping in our soul
Cause we believe
Cause we believe
Yeah we believe
Cause we believe
Cause we believe
Cause we believe
Because we need
Because what we need
