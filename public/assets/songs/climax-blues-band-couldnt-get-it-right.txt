D            E         D               A
Time was drifting this rock had got to roll
G                             D      C
So I hit the road and made my getaway
D              E D            A
Restless feeling really got a hold
G                         E
I started searching for a better way

      D                     A                         Em
And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
Em                          F#m G                     D    A
But I couldn't see the light    no I couldn't see the light
  D                     A                          Em
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Em              C                     E
Couldn't get it right couldn't get it right

Philly Fever made me feel alright
G                           D       C
But I must admit it got the best of me
D           E   D               A
Getting down so deep I could've drowned
G                              E
Now I can't get back the way I used to be

      D                     A                         Em
And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night

New York City took me with the tide
G                           D     C
And I nearly died from hospitality
D            E   D            A
Left me stranded took away my pride
G                         E
Just another no account fatality
