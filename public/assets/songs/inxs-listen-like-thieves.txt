On the talk back show
Bm
On the radio
Bm
At the local bar
Bm     A
In the hot traffic
A                     Bm
By the red tail lights

D           G             A    D
Everybody's down on their knees
G           A     D
Listen like thieves
G             A   D
But who needs that
G                A
When it's all in your hands

Bm Bm

Bm
And we take it down
Bm
To the end of town
Bm
Where they have control
A
But they're losing touch
A                     Bm
When the lights go out

D           G             A    D
Everybody's down on their knees
G           A     D
Listen like thieves
G             A   D
But who needs that
G                A
When it's all in your hands

G
Everybody's down on their knees
G
Listen like thieves for the answers
G
But who needs that
G
When you got it all in your hands
G
It's all in your hands
G
It's all in your hands

Bm Bm

Bm
You are all you need
Bm
You are all you need
Bm
And that is everything
Bm
So don't hesitate
A
There's no time to waste
A                           Bm
You just just do it for yourself

D                  G             A    D
I said everybody's down on their knees
G           A     D
Listen like thieves
G             A   D
But who needs that
G                A
When it's all in your hands

D   G      A  D
You got it all
D   G      A  D
You got it all
D    G      A    D
It's all in your hands
G              A
You got it all you got it all
