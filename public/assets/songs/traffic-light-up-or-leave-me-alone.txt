E           D             A
Sometimes I feel like I'm fading away
E                 D           A
You're looking at me I've got nothing to say
E             D              A              C
Don't make me angry with the games that you play
       D           A        E
Either light up or leave me alone

E          D        A
Walk in my room you lie on my bed
E         D     A
Open your mouth shoot someone dead
E             D          A       C
All of a sudden you're inside my head
       D           A        E
Either light up or leave me alone

E           D             A
Spending my bread like it grew on a tree
E                D                A
You're trying to tell me bout the birds and the bees
E                     D          A             C
The skirt that you're wearing is way past your knees
       D           A        E
Either light up or leave me alone

E             D     A
You're up all night preaching your mind
E                D                 A
Come home in the morning with your latest find
E                 D             A               C
I'm gonna have to lay it to you straight on the line
       D           A        E
Either light up or leave me alone
