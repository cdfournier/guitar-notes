D
Left a good job in the city
D
Working for the man every night and day
D
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
D
Worrying bout the way things might have been

A
Big wheel keep on turning
Bm
Proud Mary keep on burning
D
Rolling rolling rolling on the river

D
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
D
Pumped a lot of pane down in New Orleans
D
But I never saw the good side of the city
D
Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen

A
Big wheel keep on turning
Bm
Proud Mary keep on burning
D
Rolling rolling rolling on the river

D
Rolling rolling rolling on the river

D
If you come down to the river
D
Bet you gonna find some people who live
D
You don't have to worry cause you have no money
D
People on the river are happy to give

A
Big wheel keep on turning
Bm
Proud Mary keep on burning
D
Rolling rolling rolling on the river

D
Rolling rolling rolling on the river
D
Rolling rolling rolling on the river
D
Rolling rolling rolling on the river
