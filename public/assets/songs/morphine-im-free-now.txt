D               E
I'm free now to direct a movie
D
Sing a song or write a book about yours truly
D                      E
How I'm so interesting I'm so great
D
I'm really just a fuck-up and it's such a waste
D                  E
To burn down these walls around me
D
Flexing like a heartbeat we don't like to speak
D             E              D
Don't talk to me for about a week
D
I'm sorry it just hurts to explain
D
There's something going on
D             E         D
That makes my guts ache

D                            E
I got guilt I got fear I got regret
D
I'm just a panic-stricken waste I'm such a jerk
D     G        D
I was honest I swear
D   G            D
The last thing I want to do
G        D
Honest I swear

The last thing I want to do
