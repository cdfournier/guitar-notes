No matter where you are
A           D                 A
I can still hear you when you drown
A           D        A
You've traveled very far
A              D         A
Just to see if I'll come around
A        D   A
When I'm down
C            G
All of those yesterdays
G      D
Coming around

Yesterday the sky was you
A                    D   A
And I still feel the same

Nothing left for me to do

And I still feel the same
