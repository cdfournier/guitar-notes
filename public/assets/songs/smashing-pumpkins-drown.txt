No matter where you are
A           D                 A
I can still hear you when you drown
A           D        A
You've traveled very far
A              D         A
Just to see if I'll come around
A        D   A
When I'm down
C            G
All of those yesterdays
G      D
Coming around

No matter where you are
A           D                 A
I can still hear you when you dream
A        D        A
You traveled very far
A            D          A
You traveled far like a star
A       D  A
And you are
C            G
All of those yesterdays
G      D
Coming around

Yesterday the sky was you
A                    D   A
And I still feel the same
D                      A
Nothing left for me to do
A                    D   A
And I still feel the same

A      Cm       G     A
I wish I wish I could fly
A      Cm       G     A
I wish I wish I could lie

I will I will try
A      Cm     G
I will I will

Goodbye
