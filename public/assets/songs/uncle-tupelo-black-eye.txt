Em       G
He had a black eye
G      C
He was proud of
C                G
Like some of his friends
G           D              Em     C
It made him feel somewhere outside
C             D                     G
Of everything   and everywhere he'd been

Em       G
Like his brothers
G  C
He emptied himself
C             G
And played it safe
G          D
Like their father
D            Em
He wanted to remember
Em            C     D
But he almost always
D                        G
Forgot what he was gonna say

D        Em  C D
   Black eye
D     G
Black eye

Em      G
When he realized
G    C
That this one
C           G
Was here to stay
G       D
He took down
D                      Em
All the mirrors in the hallway
Em          C    D                G
And thought only   of his younger face

D        Em  C D
   Black eye
D     G
Black eye
