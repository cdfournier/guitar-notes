G#                                  F#
I'm trapped here as my senses bleed
G#                                  F#
I can't recall which things I need
G#                                  F#
You show up late and stumble in
G#                                  F#
Unsure if you are still Corrine

G#                                  F#
My captive gaze inside your eyes
G#                                  F#
Reveal a thing you've tried to hide
G#                                  F#
Attempting to record this view
G#                                  F#
Reflections drive me out of you

G#
Time for the meatstick bury the meatstick
F#
Take out the meatstick time
G#
Whoa shocks my brain
F#
Whoa shocks my brain

G#
Time for the meatstick bury the meatstick
F#
Take out the meatstick time
G#
Whoa shocks my brain
F#
Whoa shocks my brain

G#                                  F#
But long before this scene concludes
G#                                  F#
The end I'm seeking still eludes
G#                                  F#
My every effort to apply
G#                                  F#
My will to moments passing by

G#                                  F#
But every time we say goodbye
G#                                  F#
The pain I can't identify
G#                                  F#
Reveals to me the hidden door
G#                                  F#
That leads to several moments more

G#
Time for the meatstick bury the meatstick
F#
Take out the meatstick time
G#
Whoa shocks my brain
F#
Whoa shocks my brain

G#
Time for the meatstick bury the meatstick
F#
Take out the meatstick time
G#
Whoa shocks my brain
F#
Whoa shocks my brain

G# F#

G#
Time for the meatstick bury the meatstick
F#
Take out the meatstick time
G#
Whoa shocks my brain
F#
Whoa shocks my brain
