Ab
I'm trapped here as my senses bleed
F#
I can't recall which things I need
Ab
You show up late and stumble in
F#
Unsure if you are still Corrine

Ab
My captive gaze inside your eyes
F#
Reveal a thing you've tried to hide
Ab
Attempting to record this view
F#
Reflections drive me out of you

Ab
Time for the meatstick
Ab
Bury the meatstick
Ab
Take out the meatstick time
F#
Whoa shocks my brain
F#
Whoa shocks my brain

Ab
Time for the meatstick
Ab
Bury the meatstick
Ab
Take out the meatstick time
F#
Whoa shocks my brain
F#
Whoa shocks my brain

Ab
But long before this scene concludes
F#
The end I'm seeking still eludes
Ab
My every effort to apply
F#
My will to moments passing by

Ab
But every time we say goodbye
F#
The pain I can't identify
Ab
Reveals to me the hidden door
F#
That leads to several moments more

Ab
Time for the meatstick
Ab
Bury the meatstick
Ab
Take out the meatstick time
F#
Whoa shocks my brain
F#
Whoa shocks my brain

Ab
Time for the meatstick
Ab
Bury the meatstick
Ab
Take out the meatstick time
F#
Whoa shocks my brain
F#
Whoa shocks my brain

Ab F#

Ab
Time for the meatstick
Ab
Bury the meatstick
Ab
Take out the meatstick time
F#
Whoa shocks my brain
F#
Whoa shocks my brain

Ab
Time for the meatstick
Ab
Bury the meatstick
Ab
Take out the meatstick time
F#
Whoa shocks my brain
F#
Whoa shocks my brain
