Wanna tell you a story
About the house-rent blues

D
I come home one Friday
Had to tell the landlady I done lost my job
She said That don't confront me
Long as I get my money next Friday
Now next Friday come I didn't get the rent
And out the door I went

D
So I goes to the landlady
I said you let me slide
I'll have the rent for ya tomorrow the next day I don't know
So she let me slide it on you know people
I notice when I come home in the evening
She ain't got nothing nice to say to me
But for five year she was so nice
Lord she was lovey-dovey

D
I come home one particular evening
The landlady said You got the rent money yet
I said no can't find no job
Therefore I ain't got no money to pay the rent
She said I don't believe you're trying to find no job
Said I seen you today you were standing on a corner
Leaning up against a post
I said but I'm tired
I been walking all day
She said that don't confront me
Long as I get my money next Friday
Now next Friday come I didn't have the rent
And out the door I went

D
So I go down the streets
Down to my good friend's house
I said look man I'm outdoors you know
Can I stay with you maybe a couple of days
He said ah let me go and ask my wife
He come out of the house
I could see it in his face I know that was No
He said ah I don't know man ah she kinda funny you know
I said I know everybody funny
Now you funny too

D
So I go back home
I tell the landlady I got a job I'm gonna pay the rent
She said yeah I said Oh yeah
And then she was so nice
Lord she was lovey-dovey

D
So I go in my room pack up my things and I go
I slip on out the back door and down the streets I go
She a-howling about the front rent
She'll be lucky to get any back rent
She ain't gonna get none of it

D
So I stop in the local bar you know people
I go to the bar I ring my coat I call the bartender
