I know a man who lives under his covers
Uh uh uh uh uh uh
Lost his mind from the TV
Now he's playing God
And somebody told him that he was no good at
Uh uh uh uh uh uh
He's talking out of the left side of his mouth

And he won't follow
These lines he's drawn for him
And he don't want to try
Seeing is believing
Lord knows what he sees here every night

Three little boys dress up in the morning
Uh uh uh uh uh uh
Come back home from the school yard
Talking bout Love
But on this occasion the boys feel the same
Uh uh uh uh uh uh
Something's holding them back there
I bet it was their mom

And they won't follow
These lines he's drawn for them
Cause they don't want to try
Seeing is believing
Lord knows what they see here every night

And we both know
That people change
When truth's not part of their lives
I've seen the love in their eyes
Don't say goodbye
Goodbye

I know a man who wakes up in the evening
Uh uh uh uh uh uh
Lost his mind from the TV
Now he's blaming God
And somebody told him that he's good for nothing
Uh uh uh uh uh uh
Now he screen prints American T-shirts
Through the night

And he won't follow
These lines they've drawn for him
And he don't want to try
Seeing is believing
Lord knows what he sees here every night
