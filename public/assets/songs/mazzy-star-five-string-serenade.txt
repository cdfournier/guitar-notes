G          A           C
This is my five string serenade
G           A        C
Beneath the water we play
G             A           C
And while I'm playing for you
G        A          C
It could be raining there too

And while I'm playing for you
G        A          C
It could be raining there too

C                 D
And on my easel I drew
C                       D
While I was thinking of you
C                     D
And on the roof of my head
C                      D
In came my five string serenade
