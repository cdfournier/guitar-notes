D A C G

D                         A
Oh I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
C                       G
I used to go see on the landing in the summer
D
She fell in love with the drummer
A
She fell in love with the drummer
C
She fell in love

D                     A
Shiny shiny pants and bleached blond hair
C                         G
A double kick drum by the river in the summer
D
She fell in love with the drummer
A
Another then another
C
She fell in love

G          A              D
I miss the innocence I've known
G                   A             D
Playing KISS covers beautiful and stoned

D                  A
Unlock my body and move myself to dance
C                          G
Moving warm liquid flowing blowing glass
D               A                                C
Classical music blasting masks the ringing in my ears

D                         A
