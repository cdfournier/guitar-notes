E

E  C      D                   A
My my the clock in the sky is pounding away
A       E
There's so much to say
E        C        D              A
A face a voice an overdub has no choice
A        E
An image cannot rejoice

A                D           E
Wanting to be to hear and to see
A     G       D
Crying to the sky
D       E           D        A           D
But the porpoise is laughing goodbye goodbye
G                   D
Goodbye goodbye goodbye

E      C      D                   A
Clicks clacks riding the backs of giraffes
A               E
For laughs is alright for a while
E       C        D           A
The ego sings of castles and kings
A                         E
And things that go with a life of style

A                  D            E
Wanting to feel to know what is real
A     G     D
Living is a lie
D   E           D       A           D
The porpoise is waiting goodbye goodbye
G                   D
Goodbye goodbye goodbye

G                   D
Goodbye goodbye goodbye
G                   Bm
Goodbye goodbye goodbye
