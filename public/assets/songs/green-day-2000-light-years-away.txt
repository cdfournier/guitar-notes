  G   D
I sit alone in my bedroom
C              D
Staring at the walls
     G       D
I've been up all damn night long
C                    D
My pulse is speeding my love is yearning

C                    G
I hold my breath and close my eyes and
C             D
I dream about her
C           D                G
Cause she's 2000 light years away
C            G                  C
She holds my malachite so tight so
          D
Never let go
C           D                G
Cause she's 2000 light years away

  G   D
I sit outside and watch the sunrise
C                   D
Lookout as far as I can
C               D
I can't see her but in the distance
C                    D
I hear some laughter we laugh together

C                    G
I hold my breath and close my eyes and
C             D
I dream about her
C           D                G
Cause she's 2000 light years away
C            G                  C
She holds my malachite so tight so
          D
Never let go
C           D                G
Cause she's 2000 light years away
D
