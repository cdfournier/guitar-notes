And I felt glad in my own suspicious way

There's malice and there's magic in every season

G                F               Em        C
From the foaming breakers of the poisonous surf
    G     Em      Am D
The other side of summer
G              F              Em       C
To the burning forests in the hills of Astroturf

The other side of summer

A teenage girl is crying 
A         D                 C

So help her if you can
C                       D                  C
Cause she don't seem to have the attention span

The sun will struggle up the world will still keep turning

Madman standing by the side of the road saying

The other side of summer

The dancing was desperate the music was worse
