  G            D           Em        D
I met her at a bar where I often sit down
    G    D        Em   D
And have myself a drink
C                      Am
She played my favorite song
  C                  D
Before I had time to think

     G            D             Em         D
So I bought her a round and she pounded it down
G         D            Em      D
Let out a laugh like a freight train
C                  Am
We exchanged small talk
C                    D
Doesn't it feel that way

D        C               D
She said you and I we're two of a kind
G   D         Em
Not afraid to dream
Em       C      D
We could be the next big thing

G D Em D - G D Em D

    G           D            Em           D
She told me her roommate was gone for the weekend
G            D            Em           D
Borrowed her car and took off with her boyfriend
C                 Am
They'd be married soon
C                  D
Was it December or June

G          D             Em          D
She was an artist with a two bedroom apartment
    G            D          Em     D
Her dad kept her going on a weekly allowance
C                   Am
She'd be graduating soon
C                  D
Was it December or June

D        C               D
She said you and I we're two of a kind
G   D         Em
Not afraid to dream
Em       C      D
We could be the next big thing

G D Em D - G D Em D

G                   D            Em            D
So I bought her one more and she stared at the door
G            D             Em      D
Watching the parade moving out and in
C                     Am
She made fun of their clothes
Am            C                       D
She said that I could never be one of those

G                D                       Em        D
And I thought to myself you're just like everybody else
G               D           Em          D
Standing at the station but missing the train
C                     Am
I turned to catch her expression
    C                       D
She walked back home in the rain

D          C               D
And I said you and I we're two of a kind
G   D         Em
Not afraid to dream
Em          C        D
We could've been the next big thing
G  D  Em  D
      The next big thing
G  D  Em  D
      The next big thing
G  D  Em  D
      The next big thing
