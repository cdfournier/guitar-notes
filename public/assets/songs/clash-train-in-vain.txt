D A Bm F#m

A                D A           D A
You say you stand   by your man
A                   D A                  D A
So tell me something   I don't understand
A            D                    Bm
You said you love me and that's a fact
Bm                  D A                     D A
And then you left me   said you felt trapped
A         D                      A
Well some things you can explain away
A       Bm                         D
But the heartache's in me til this day

                      D A
You didn't stand by me
A            D A
No not at all
A                     D A
You didn't stand by me
A     D A
No way

A            D A                  D A
All the times   when we were close
A            D A                     D A
I'll remember   these things the most
A            D                    Bm
I see all my dreams come tumbling down
Bm              D A                  D A
I can't be happy   without you around
A  D                          A
So alone I keep the wolves at bay
A           Bm                   D
And there's only one thing I can say

                      D A
You didn't stand by me
A            D A
No not at all
A                     D A
You didn't stand by me
A     D A
No way

A        F#m Bm
You must explain
Bm              D A D A
Why this must be
A       F#m Bm
Did you lie
Bm                  D A D A
When you spoke to me
A                  D A
Did you stand by me
A            D A
No not at all

A              D A                D A
Now I got a job   but it don't pay
A                 D A                        D A
I need new clothes   I need somewhere to stay
A       D                             Bm
But without all of these things I can do
Bm                   D A                       D A
But without your love   I won't make it through
A   D                                A
But you don't understand my point of view
A    Bm                         D
I suppose there's nothing I can do

                      D A

A            D A
