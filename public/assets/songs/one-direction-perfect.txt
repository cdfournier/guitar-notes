D                     G
I might never be your knight in shining armor
Bm                   G
I might never be the one you take home to mother
D                        G
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
Bm                   G
But I can be the one be the one tonight

D
When I first saw you
G
From across the room
Bm                         G
I could tell that you were curious
D
Girl I hope you're sure
G
What you're looking for
Bm                           G
Cause I'm not good at making promises

G          D
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
D          G
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
G      Bm
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Bm            G
Then baby I'm perfect
G
Baby I'm perfect for you

G          D
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
D          G
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
G      Bm
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Bm               G
Then baby you're perfect
G
Baby you're perfect
G                    D
So let's start right now

D                    G
I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Bm                        G
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
D                                 G
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
Bm                         G
Cause I can be the one you love from time to time

D

And if you like cameras flashing every time we go out
G             Bm
And if you're looking for someone to write your breakup songs about
Bm       G
Baby I'm perfect
G
Baby we're perfect
