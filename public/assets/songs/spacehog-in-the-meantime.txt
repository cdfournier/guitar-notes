E                       F#m
And in the end we shall achieve in time
    D                 E
The thing they call divine
E            F#m                  A
When all the stars will smile for me
E           F#m              D
When all is well and well is all
D   A               E
For all and forever after
E                 A                 E
Well maybe in the meantime wait and see

  We love the all the all of you
A                 D         F#m           Bm

E                       F#m
And when I cry for me I cry for you
     D             E
With tears of holy joy
E           F#m                  A
For all the days you've still to come
E                      F#m
And did I ever say I'd never play
   D              E
Or fly toward the sun
E            A                    E
Maybe in the meantime something's wrong

A             D              F#m  Bm

  Well that sounds fine so I'll see you sometime
C       D                              G
Give my love to the future of the humankind
G    D             Em
Okay okay it's not okay
C
While it's on my mind there's a girl that fits the crime
C     Bm                         Em
For a future love dream that I'm still to find
Em             E
But in the meantime
