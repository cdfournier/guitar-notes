Who's that gigolo on the street
F        G 
With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet
F 
Hanging off the curb looking all disturbed
F       G 
Ask the boys from home they all came running
G         F 
They were making noise manhandling toys
F           G 
There's the girls on the block with the nasty curls
G       F 
Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws
F        G 
Dropping down their drawers where did you get yours

Em
(Gigolo) Huh sucka (Gigolo gigolo) Huh sucka (Gigolo)

So you say you wanted money but you know it's never funny
F         G 
When your shoes worn through and there's a rumble in your tummy
G       F 
But you had to have style get a gold tooth smile
F     G 
Put a girl on the corner so you could make a pile
G           F 
Committed a crime and went inside
F      G 
It was coming your way but you had to survive
G        F 
When you lost your babe you lost the race
F              G 
And now you're looking at me to take her place
