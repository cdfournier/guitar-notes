Hanging off the curb looking all disturbed

Ask the boys from home they all came running
Gm        Fm
They were making noise manhandling toys
Fm          Gm
There's the girls on the block with the nasty curls
Gm      Fm
Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws
Fm       Gm
Dropping down their drawers where did you get yours
