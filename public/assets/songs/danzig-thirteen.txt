Em Am G

Em
Bad luck wind been blowing on my back
      Am                    G            Em
I was born to bring trouble wherever I'm at
Em
With the number 13 tattooed on my neck
     Am
That ink starts to itch
G                   Em
Black gonna turn to red

      Am                  Em
I was born in the soul of misery
      Am             Em
And I never had me a name
Am                  G                 Em
They just give me a number when I was young

Em
Got a long line of heartache I carry it well
    Am
The list of lives I've broken
G                  Em
Reach from here to Hell
Em
And a bad luck wind been blowing on my back
Am
Pray you don't look at me
      G                 Em
And I pray I don't look back

      Am                  Em
I was born in the soul of misery
      Am             Em
And I never had me a name
Am                  G                 Em
They just give me a number when I was young

Em
Found me with a preacher man confessing all I done
Am                      G       Em
Catch me with the devil playing 21
Em
And a bad luck wind been blowing on my back
      Am                    G            Em
I was born to bring trouble wherever I'm at

      Am                  Em
I was born in the soul of misery
      Am             Em
And I never had me a name
Am                  G                 Em
They just give me a number when I was young
           Em
When I was young
           Em
When I was young
           Em
When I was young
