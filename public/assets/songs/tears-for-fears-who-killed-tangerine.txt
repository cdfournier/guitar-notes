Dm Am

Dm                        Am            Dm
What you gonna choose the poison or the knife
Am                      Em       Am
Lived with crazy paving all your life
Dm                         Am        Dm
Something in her eyes just tells you no
Am                  Em        Am
Hoping conversation starts to flow

G                             C
Stuck inside a wheel inside a wheel
G                                C
Wondering everyday is it all for real
A                             Dm
Aching every time a cold wind blows
Am            G               D
My love don't fear the mighty rose

Dm        Am
Tangerine Tangerine

Dm                         Am                 Dm
What you gonna do when the old man bleeds you dry
Am                           Em        Am
Step down from the plane and pluck the eye
Dm              Am            Dm
Slide in deeper closer to the bone
Am                       Em                Am
Don't you just wish your heart was made of stone

G                                C
Waxing like an old cracked forty-five
G                                  C
Counting out the ways you can stay alive
A                                   Dm
Placed in body bags and filled with stones
Am            G               D
My love won't bleed her waves are foam

D                           C
And when you think it's all over
C        G             D
It's not over it's not over
D                           C
And when you think it's all over
C        G             D
It's not over it's not over
D        G             D
It's not over it's not over

Dm        Am
Tangerine Tangerine
Am                   Dm
Who killed Tangerine prettiest girl I've ever seen
Am                   Dm
Who killed Tangerine

D                           C
And when you think it's all over
C        G             D
It's not over it's not over
D                           C
And when you think it's all over
C        G             D
It's not over it's not over
D        G             D
It's not over it's not over
