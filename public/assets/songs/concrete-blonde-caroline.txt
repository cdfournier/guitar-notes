       C
Well I hear you're driving someone else's car now
    Em
She said you came and took your stuff away
        C
All the poetry and the trunk you kept your life in
  Em
I knew that it would come to that someday

       C
Like a sad hallucination
C
When I opened up my eyes
    Em
The train had passed the station
Em
And you were trapped inside
      C
Yet I never wonder where you went
C                          D
I only wonder why I wonder why

   C
Oh Caroline
   Em
Oh Caroline
   C
Oh Caroline
   Em
Oh Caroline

       C
Well I hear you're using someone else's number
    Em
She said she saw you in the store today
           C
It doesn't matter whose address you're listed under
  Em
I only know they'll never make you stay

       C
Like a memory in motion
C
You were only passing through
        Em
That is all you've ever known of life that's all you'll ever do
          C
There's a dream I have where I sail away
C                                         D
Looking back I wave at you and I wave goodbye

   C
Oh Caroline
   Em
Oh Caroline
   C
Oh Caroline
   Em
Oh Caroline

C Em C Em

   C
In another life I see you as an angel flying high
        Em
And the hands of time will free you
Em
You will cast your chains aside
        C
And the dawn will come and kiss away
C                                       D
Every tear that's ever fallen from your eyes
D
Behind those eyes I wonder

   C
Oh Caroline (Caroline Caroline)
   Em
Oh Caroline
    C
Sometimes I wonder (Caroline)
   Em
Oh Caroline
    C
Sometimes I sometimes I wonder (Caroline)
   Em
Oh Caroline
