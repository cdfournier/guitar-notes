If it's a temporary lull
D                            C
Why'm I bored right outta my skull
C                                  D
Man I'm dressing sharp and feeling dull

G                               D
Lonely I guess that's where I'm from
D             C
If I was from Canada
C                       D
Then I'd best be called lonesome

    G              D
And if it's just a game
D         F                  Em
Then I'll break down just in case
   C          G          Em       F   D
Oh yeah we're running in our last race

D      G                       D
Well I laughed half the way to Tokyo
D                     C
I dreamt I was Surfer Joe
C                           D
And what that means I don't know

  G                       D
A dream too tired to come true
D                      C
Left a rebel without a clue
C                                  D
And I'm searching for something to do

    G              D
And if it's just a game
D          F                   Em
Then we'll hold hands just the same
   C                    G            Em       F   D
So what (so what) we're bleeding but we ain't cut
D           G             D
And I could purge my soul perhaps
D       F        Em
For the imminent collapse
   C                   G             Em       F   D
Oh yeah (oh yeah) I'll tell you what we could do
D               Am                G   D
You be me for a while and I'll be you

Won't you tell me what I should do

    G              D
And if it's just a lull
D       F                    Em
Why'm I bored right outta my skull
   C        G            Em         F   D
Oh yeah I'm keeping from feeling so dull
    G              D
And if it's just a game
D          F                  Em
Then we'll break down just in case

Then again I'll tell you what we could do

You be me for a while
Em              A
You be me for a while
A           G                    
And I'll be you
