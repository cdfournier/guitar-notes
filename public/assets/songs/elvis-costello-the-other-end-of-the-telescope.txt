C        G          D         G
Shall we agree that just this once
G   Em              D
I'm gonna change my life
C          G       D    G  Em               F
Until it's just as tiny or important as you like

       C             G    D              C
And in time we won't even recall that we spoke
C          G             D            C
Words that turned out to be as big as smoke
C  G          D                 G
As smoke that disappears in the air
C              G                D          G
There's always something that's smoldering somewhere

D                      C             G
I know it don't make a difference to you
D                     C             G
But oh It sure made a difference to me
G             D          C          G
You'll see me off in the distance I hope
G            Am
At the other end
Am           C      D   C        G
At the other end of the telescope

G   C          G                D            G
The promise of indulgence in my confidential voice
Approached immortal danger but you'll never know how close
Then down the hall I overheard such a heavenly choir
They interrupted my evil designs
One day you are up in the clouds
The next thing you're down with the Sweet Adelines

Lie down baby now don't say a word
There there baby your vision is blurred
Your head is so sore from all of that thinking
I don't want to hurt you now
But I think you're shrinking

You're half-naked ambition and you're half out of your wits
Or several tiny fractions that this portrait still omits
And it's so hard to pick the receiver up when I call
I never noticed you could be so small
The answer was under your nose but the question never arose

I know it don't make a difference to you
But oh It sure made a difference to me
Cause late in the evening as I sit here moping
With a bamboo needle on a shellac of Chopin
And the cast-iron heart that you failed to tear open
At the other end
At the other end of the telescope
