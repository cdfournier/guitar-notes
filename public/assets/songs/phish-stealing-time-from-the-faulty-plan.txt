Am                         D
Got a blank space where my mind should be
Am                      D
Got a Clif Bar and some cold green tea
Am                      D
Got clouds that seem to follow me
Am                        D
Got strange demands piled up on me

E
Got memories got memories
E                              Am
Got memories memories of being free

Am                        D
Gonna steal time from the faulty plan
Am                      D
Gonna act as though I'm still a man
Am                      D
Gonna give you one last chance to see
Am                         D
Gonna shrug demands off of me

E
Gonna dream gonna dream

Gonna dream gonna dream
E              Am
