E                        D
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
  A                         G      E
I like watching the puddles gather rain
    E                    D
And all I can do is just pour some tea for two
    A
And speak my point of view
    G        E
But it's not sane it's not sane

E           D                 E        D
I just want someone to say to me oh oh oh oh
E              D              E    D
I'll always be there when you wake yeah
E                    D                  E    D
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
E            D                   E     D
So stay with me and I'll have it made (I'll have it made)

D     E                      D
And I don't understand why I sleep all day
D     A                      G          E
And I start to complain that there's no rain
    E                      D
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
D      A                            G     E
And it rips my life away but it's a great escape
Escape escape escape
