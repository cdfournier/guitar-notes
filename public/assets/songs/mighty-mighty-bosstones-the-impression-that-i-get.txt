         C                  Am
Have you ever been close to tragedy
        C                  Am
Or been close to folks who have
         C                   Am
Have you ever felt a pain so powerful
         C   Am
So heavy you collapse
D  G
No well

     C                     G
I've never had to knock on wood
G                      Em
But I know someone who has
Em                         F
Which makes me wonder if I could
F
It makes me wonder if I've
C                     G
Never had to knock on wood
G                      Em
And I'm glad I haven't yet
Em                        F
Because I'm sure it isn't good
F
That's the impression that I get

         C                         Am
Have you ever had the odds stacked up so high
           C                   Am
You need a strength most don't possess
          C                 Am
Or has it ever come down to do or die
              C              Am
You've got to rise above the rest
D  G
No well

C                G
I'm not a coward I've just never been tested
C                           G
I'd like to think that if I was I would pass
C                  G
Look at the tested and think there but for the grace go I
C                 G
Might be a coward I'm afraid of what I might find out

C                     G
