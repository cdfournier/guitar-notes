G                 D
It doesn't take a genius
D  Am             C
To tell me what I am
   G               D
Or lecture me with poetry
D   Am             C
And tell me that I can
G         D
I don't remember
D    Am             C
What happened yesterday
    G              D
But I don't give a damn
D          Am               C
About what all those people say

C        G                 D
It takes years to find the nerve
D     Am                     C
To be apart from what you've done
C           G            D
To find the truth inside yourself
D       Am        C
And not depend on anyone

G                D
It don't take no Houdini
D  Am             C
To tell me what I am
G             D
Parasites and litrosites
D      Am              C
They'd burn me if they can
    G              D
But I don't give a damn
D     Am                C
About what those people say
     G               D
They pick you up and kick you out
D    Am             C
They hurt you every day
