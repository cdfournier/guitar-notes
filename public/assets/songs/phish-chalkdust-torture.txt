E A

     E                       A
Come stumble my mirth beaten worker
A                               E A - E A
I'm Jezmund the Family Berzerker
    E                         A
I'm bought for the price of a flagon of rice
    E
The wind buffs the cabin
    A
You speak of your life
A                                  E A - E A
Or more willingly Locust the Lurker

E A - E A

E                           A
Confuse what you can of the ending
A                                   E A - E A
And revise your despise so impending
        E
Cause I soak on the wrath
E        A
That you didn't quite mask
    E                                    A
I'm getting it clearly through alternate paths
A                                         E A - E A
Or mixed in with the signal you're sending

G                           A
But who can unlearn all the facts that I've learned
     G                          E
As I sat in their chairs and my synapses burned
    G                     A
The torture of chalk dust collects on my tongue
G                             A
Thoughts follow my vision and dance in the sun
       G                          A
All my vasoconstrictors they come slowly undone
G
Can't this wait til I'm old
        E                   A 
Can't I live while I'm young

E A - E A - E A - E A

    E                    A
But no peace for Jezmund tonight
A                                E A - E A
I plug the distress tube up tight
    E                      A
And watch what I say as it flutters away
    E                                    A
And all this emotion is kept harmless at bay
A                               E A - E A
Not to educate somebody's fright

G                           A
But who can unlearn all the facts that I've learned
     G                          E
As I sat in their chairs and my synapses burned
    G                     A
The torture of chalk dust collects on my tongue
G                             A
Thoughts follow my vision and dance in the sun
       G                          A
All my vasoconstrictors they come slowly undone
G
Can't this wait til I'm old
        E                   A
Can't I live while I'm young
        E                   A
Can't I live while I'm young
        E                   A
Can't I live while I'm young
        E                   A
Can't I live while I'm young
