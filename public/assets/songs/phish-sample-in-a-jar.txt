A C G D - A E Em D

A               C
It's hidden far away
    G             D
But someday I may tell
A                  E
The tale of mental tangle
     Em                D
When into your world I fell
A                 C
Without you now I wander soaking
G        D
Secretly afraid
A                       E
Cause in your grasp the fears don't last
       Em                D
Though some of them have stayed

A         D
I wheeled around because I
E      D                 A 
Didn't hear what you had said
A           D            E
And saw you dancing with Elihu
D              A
Up on Leemor's bed
A         D            E
And I was foggy rather groggy
D                   A
You helped me to my car
A   D            E
The binding belt enclosing me
  D           A
A sample in a jar

A C G D - A E Em D

A                          C
And on the market stands unfolding
               G                 D
With all their willies and their wares
A            E
I shuffle by alert but numb
           Em              D
To all the glances and the glares
A                  C
And I think of you unheeding
        G                D
All the times I raise my cup
A                    E
It's now I know that you knew that
Em                  D
I'd soon end up end up

A         D
I wheeled around because I
E      D                 A 
Didn't hear what you had said
A           D            E
And saw you dancing with Elihu
D              A
Up on Leemor's bed
A         D            E
And I was foggy rather groggy
D                   A
You helped me to my car
A   D            E
The binding belt enclosing me
  D
A sample in a jar

    C                   D
You tricked me like the others
    A           G
And now I don't belong
    C                 D                   E
The simple smiles and good times seem all wrong

A         D
I wheeled around because I
E      D                 A 
Didn't hear what you had said
A           D            E
And saw you dancing with Elihu
D              A
Up on Leemor's bed
A         D            E
And I was foggy rather groggy
