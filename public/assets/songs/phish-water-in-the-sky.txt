Listen as she speaks to you
F               C
Hear the voices flutter through
C                        G
The barriers arranged by you

Close the shudders draw the shades

Glistening with evening dew

Thunder calls through waterfalls

Rising tides and ocean walls

I can hear you when you sigh

C                   G        C
Watch them fall and let them lie
