C
Someone told me long ago
C
There's a calm before the storm
  G                     C
I know it's been coming for some time
C
When it's over so they say
C
It'll rain a sunny day
  G                      C
I know shining down like water

F       G             C    Am       C
I wanna know have you ever seen the rain
F       G             C    Am       C
I wanna know have you ever seen the rain
F      G               C  G
Coming down on a sunny day

C
Yesterday and days before
C
Sun is cold and rain is hard
  G                      C
I know been that way for all my time
C
Til forever on it goes
C
Through the circle fast and slow
  G                    C
I know it can't stop I wonder

F       G             C    Am       C
I wanna know have you ever seen the rain
F       G             C    Am       C
I wanna know have you ever seen the rain
F      G               C  G
Coming down on a sunny day

F       G             C    Am       C
I wanna know have you ever seen the rain
F       G             C    Am       C
I wanna know have you ever seen the rain
F      G               C  G
Coming down on a sunny day
