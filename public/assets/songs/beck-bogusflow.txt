Laminate your face and paste it up into the sky
G          C            
Cause it's squalid and it's solid
G                   C
And it's completely rancid and beautiful
G                    C
Like a forcefield of multiplying meat
G                 C
Cut a hole in the floor to see
G                 C
Just how close to hell we're standing

G                   C
Time shoots forward in your skull
G                           C
Scattered to the four winds chucked in the bucket

Amplified dishwashers exploring the boring to the core

Running around in new wave bionic jogging suits

California white boy sound

Rocket-powered and nailed to the ground
G               C
New age old age totally lame
G               C
Straight to the middle of the road
G               C
Rewind the tape play the whole thing backwards
G              C
With the sound completely turned off
