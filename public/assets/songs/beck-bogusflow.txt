Monkey see monkey die

Laminate your face and paste it up into the sky
C                           G
Cause it's squalid and it's solid
G        C                     G
And it's completely rancid and beautiful
C                         G
Like a forcefield of multiplying meat
C                          G
Cut a hole in the floor to see
C                            G       C
Just how close to hell we're standing

G                   C
Time shoots forward in your skull
G                           C
Scattered to the four winds chucked in the bucket
G               C           G                C
Riding lamppost moldy toast excitement level zero

Amplified dishwashers exploring the boring to the core

People with cordless personalities

Running around in new wave bionic jogging suits

Rocket-powered and nailed to the ground
G               C
New age old age totally lame
G               C
Straight to the middle of the road
G               C
Rewind the tape play the whole thing backwards
G              C
With the sound completely turned off
