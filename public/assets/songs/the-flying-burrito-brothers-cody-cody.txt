Cody Cody I hear you say
D                 E          A   G
I hear your voice calling me away
D                                       G   E
I'm not afraid to think of what I might find
E         D          A      G   D
I will be yours will you be mine

D              A                    D
We've all been young we've all been old
D              E                  A   G
We've all been sheltered from the cold
D                                              G   E
Come by my side and say what I think I already know
E         D              A       G  D
I'm going away don't you want to go

D              A                D
I remember the face that Harvey drew
D               E                A      G
It was of a man that my eyes saw through
D                                     G   E
Come by my side before the evening is gone
E             D         A      G    D
And see where else this body's flown
