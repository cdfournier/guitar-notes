G                   D
So long ago I don't remember when
D      F#                           Bm    A
That's when they say I lost my only friend
A         G                       D
Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
D    F#                            Bm    A
As I listened through the cemetery trees

A          G                    D
I seen the sun coming up at the funeral at dawn
D   F#                       Bm    A
The long broken arm of human law
A      G                              D
Now it always seemed such a waste she always had a pretty face
D    F#                                Bm    A
So I wondered why she hung around this place

G  F#
     Hey

G
Come on try a little
D
Nothing is forever
Em                          A
There's got to be something better than
A
In the middle
G
But me and Cinderella
D
Put it all together
Em                  A
We can drive it home
A            G
With one headlight

G D F# Bm A

A             G                      D
She said it's cold it feels like Independence Day
D     F#                         Bm    A
And I can't break away from this parade
A           G                    D
But there's got to be an opening
D
Somewhere here in front of me
F#                                Bm    A
Through this maze of ugliness and greed

A              G                   D
And I seen the sun up ahead at the county line bridge
D      F#                                  Bm    A
Saying all there's good and nothingness is dead
A     G
We'll run until she's out of breath
    D
She ran until there's nothing left
D   F#                               Bm    A
She hit the end it's just her window ledge

G  F#
     Hey hey

G
Come on try a little
D
Nothing is forever
Em                          A
There's got to be something better than
A
In the middle
G
But me and Cinderella
D
Put it all together
Em                  A
We can drive it home
A            G
With one headlight

G D F# Bm A - G D F# Bm A

A                  G                        D
Well this place is old it feels just like a beat-up truck
D          F#                            Bm    A
I turn the engine but the engine doesn't turn
A              G
What smells of cheap wine and cigarettes
     D
This place is always such a mess
D   F#                                 Bm    A
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn

A      G                              D
I'm so alone and I feel just like somebody else
D           F#                             Bm    A
Man I ain't changed but I know I ain't the same
A   G
But somewhere here in between
    D
The city walls of dying dreams
D F#                                 Bm    A
I think her death it must be killing me

G  F#
     Hey hey hey

G
Come on try a little
D
Nothing is forever
Em                          A
There's got to be something better than
A
In the middle
G
But me and Cinderella
D
Put it all together
Em                  A
We can drive it home
A            G
