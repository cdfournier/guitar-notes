D     A                   F#m
Did I ever take you in my arms
F#m             C#m
Look you in the eye
C#m             D
Tell you that I do
D     A               E
Did I ever open up my heart
    Em           A
And let you look inside

A          E            A           F#m
If I never did it I was only waiting
F#m          E           A
For a better moment that didn't come
A           E            A          F#m
There never could be a better moment
     Bm   E        A
Than this one this one

A                             F#m
The swan is gliding above the ocean
F#m                      C#m
A god is riding upon his back
C#m          D         A          E
How calm the water and bright the rainbow
     Em          A
Fade this one to black

A          E            A           F#m
Did I ever touch you on the cheek
F#m               C#m
Say that you were mine
C#m               D
Thank you for the smile
D     A               E
Did I ever knock upon your door
Em           A
Try to get inside

A          E            A           F#m
If I never did it I was only waiting
F#m          E           A
For a better moment that didn't come
A           E            A          F#m
There never could be a better moment

D         E            A           F#m
What opportunities did we allow to flow by
G                Em            A
Feeling like the timing wasn't quite right
D            E                A
What kind of magic might have worked
A         F#m
If we had stayed calm
G                           E
Couldn't I have given you a better life

D       A                    F#m
Did you ever take me in your arms
F#m            C#m
Look me in the eye
C#m              D
Tell me that you do

The swan is gliding oh
