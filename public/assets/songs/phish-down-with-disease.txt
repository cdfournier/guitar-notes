A
Down with disease three weeks in my bed
A
Trying to stop these demons that keep dancing in my head

D  F G - D  F G

A
Down with disease up before the dawn
A
A thousand barefoot children outside dancing on my lawn

D  F G

D       C#    C
Dancing on my lawn and I keep

A                         G             D
Waiting for the time when I can finally say
     G                 D             G             C
That this has all been wonderful but now I'm on my way
A                             G              D
But when I think it's time to leave it all behind
  G             D               G             C
I try to find a way but there's nothing I can say to make it stop
A              G         D
Stop stop stop stop stop stop stop
A                   G         D
Stop stop stop stop stop stop stop

A
Down with disease and the jungles in my mind
A
They're climbing up my waterfalls and swinging on my vines

D  F G - D  F G

A
So I try to hear the music but I'm always losing time
A
Cause they're stepping on my rhythm and they're stealing all my lines

D  F G

D        C#     C
Stealing all my lines and I keep

A                         G             D
Waiting for the time when I can finally say
     G                 D             G             C
That this has all been wonderful but now I'm on my way
A                             G              D
But when I think it's time to leave it all behind
  G             D               G             C
I try to find a way but there's nothing I can say to make it stop
A              G         D
Stop stop stop stop stop stop stop
A                   G         D
Stop stop stop stop stop stop stop
