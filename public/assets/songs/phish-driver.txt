I'll tell you about the driver who lives inside my head
G                C            Em           D
Starts me up and stops me and puts me into bed
G                              C              G
He opens up my mouth when it's time for me to talk
G               C                        G
And fires up my legs when he wants me to walk

C             G    C           G
Keeps my eyes open most of the day
C          G          Em                 D
Adds to my memory the things that people say
C             G         C               Em
When he makes decisions I don't have to wait
C                                              G
But sometimes it seems he's got to much on his plate

G                                C                         G
Like this morning when I woke up and he dressed me in this shirt
G                   C               Em                     D
That looks a little ragged where he dragged me through the dirt
G                            C                          G
I'm moving through this life and I'm thinking about the next
G                 C                        G
And hoping when I get there I'll be better dressed

C             G    C           G
Keeps my eyes open most of the day
C          G          Em                 D
Adds to my memory the things that people say
C             G         C               Em
When he makes decisions I don't have to wait
