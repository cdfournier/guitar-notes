D       G       C
Doesn't seem to matter what I do
C          Em
I'm always number two
Em     C
No one knows how hard I tried
   D       G               C
Oh I  have feelings that I can't explain
C          Em
Driving me insane
Em     C
All my life been so polite
    D
But I'll sleep alone tonight

      A   E    F#m
Cause I'm just Ken
F#m                    A
Anywhere else I'd be a ten
A                   E
Is it my destiny to live and die
  D              A
A life of blonde fragility

A   E    F#m
I'm just Ken
F#m                         A
Where I see love she sees a friend
A                            E
What will it take for her to see 
E       D                  A
The man behind the tan and fight for me

E G                           D
  I wanna know what's like to love
D         E
To be the real thing
E       G
Is it a crime 
G        D                  E
Am I not hot when I'm in my feelings
E         G              D
And is my moment finally here
D       A
Or am I dreaming
A      Em
I'm no dreamer
