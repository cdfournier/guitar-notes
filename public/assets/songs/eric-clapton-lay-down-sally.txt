A
There is nothing that is wrong
A                                D
In wanting you to stay here with me
  A
I know you've got somewhere to go
A
But won't you make yourself at home
    D                               E
And stay with me and don't you ever leave

A                  D
Lay down Sally and rest here in my arms
E                                   A
Don't you think you want someone to talk to
A                 D
Lay down Sally no need to leave so soon
E                                       A
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

A
Sun ain't nearly on the rise
A                               D
We still got the moon and stars above
A
Underneath the velvet skies love is all that matters
A         D                      E
Won't you stay with me don't you ever leave

A                  D
Lay down Sally and rest here in my arms
E                                   A
Don't you think you want someone to talk to
A                 D
Lay down Sally no need to leave so soon
E                                       A
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

A
I long to see the morning light
A                           D
Coloring your face so dreamily
   A
So don't you go and say goodbye
A                                 D
You can lay your worries down and stay with me
D         E
Don't you ever leave

A                  D
Lay down Sally and rest here in my arms
E                                   A
Don't you think you want someone to talk to
A                         D
Lay down Sally there's no need to leave so soon
E                                       A
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

A                  D
Lay down Sally and rest here in my arms
E                                   A
Don't you think you want someone to talk to
A                         D
Lay down Sally there's no need to leave so soon
E                                       A
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you
