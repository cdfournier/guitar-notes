I'd like to rest my heavy head tonight
D
On a bed of California stars
C
I'd like to lay my weary bones tonight
G
On a bed of California stars

G
I'd love to feel your hand touching mine
D
And tell me why I must keep working on
C
Yes I'd give my life to lay my head tonight
G
On a bed of California stars

G
I'd like to dream my troubles all away
D
On a bed of California stars
C
Jump up from my starbed and make another day
G
Underneath my California stars

G
They hang like grapes on vines that shine
D
And warm a lover's glass like a friendly wine
C
So I'd give this world
C
Just to dream a dream with you
G
On our bed of California stars
