G             C
People I know places I go
G
Make me feel tongue-tied
G             C
I can see how people look down
G
They're on the inside

G      C               G
Here's where the story ends

G            C
People I see weary of me
G
Showing my good side
G             C
I can see how people look down
G
I'm on the outside

G      C               G
Here's where the story ends
G         C               G
Oh here's where the story ends

G         C
It's that little souvenir of a terrible year
C     G
Which makes my eyes feel sore
G          C
Oh I never should have said the books that you read
C    G
Were all I loved you for

G         C
It's that little souvenir of a terrible year
C     G
Which makes me wonder why
G            C
And it's the memories of the shed that make me turn red
C  G
Surprise surprise surprise

G C G

G            C
Crazy I know places I go
G
Make me feel so tired
G             C
I can see how people look down
G
I'm on the outside

G      C               G
Here's where the story ends
G         C               G
Oh here's where the story ends

G         C
It's that little souvenir of a terrible year
C     G
Which makes my eyes feel sore
G      C
And whoever would have thought the books that you brought
C    G
Were all I loved you for

G      C
Oh the devil in me said go down to the shed
  G
I know where I belong
G       C
But the only thing I ever really wanted to say
C   G
Was wrong was wrong was wrong

G         C
It's that little souvenir of a colorful year
C     G
Which makes me smile inside
G    C
So I cynically cynically say the world is that way
   G
Surprise surprise surprise surprise

G C G

G      C               G
Here's where the story ends
G         C               G
Oh here's where the story ends
