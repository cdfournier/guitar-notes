Let's have Christ our president
A               E       A
Let us have him for our king
A
Cast your vote for the carpenter
A                 E   A
That you call the Nazarene

A
The only way we can ever beat
A                 E      A
These crooked politician men
A
Is to run the money changers out of the temple
A       E         A
Put the Carpenter in

A
Oh it's Jesus Christ our president
A   E         A
God above our king
A
With a job and pension for young and old
A                 E     A
We will make hallelujah ring

A
Every year we waste enough
A           E        A
To feed the ones who starve
A
We build our civilization up
A               E         A
And we shoot it down with wars

A            E
But with the Carpenter
A      E
On the seat
A              E       A
Away up in the capital town
A       E               A
The USA would be on the way
A   E      A   E
Prosperity bound
