A A7 D

D         A
I guess I got to get this fucked up thing done
A7
First I have to get a gun
D
From some guy I picked at random
D                    A
Shit he looks like a nice guy

A         A7
His gun's probably just in a drawer
D
In his little French grocery store
D
Man I could maybe just snag it
D                        A
Without a lot of goddamn drama

A   A     D  A  D    A    D  A E A
Who knows maybe this will be e-a-s-y
A   A C     A    D  A    D           A E A
And I could have an hour off to feel e-a-s-y

D             A
Cause there's some heavy-duty stuff soon
A7
Like breaking into an armed compound
D
Fighting guys in crazy suits
D              A
And probably a dog too

A           A7
You'd think I could just breeze into
D
This guy's grocery stroll past the chips and
D
Lift his gun then cruise out
D        A
Nice and easy

A     A   D   A   D     A   D             A E A
Maybe I'm fucking crazy but this could be e-a-s-y
A   A  D   A     D    A
And in the sweet hour after
        D                    A
I could even have beers with my friends

         A7
Probably there's cool wine bars and shit
D
Around here where we can sit
D
And just shoot the breeze about the weather
D               A
And maybe girls respectfully

A   A7
I already asked my three friends to meet me
D
Around here cause this is gonna be
D
Easy goddamn it to take this sweet-faced grocer's gun
D                  A
Man he has a sweet face


Man that shit was so fucked up and sure wasn't e-a-s-y

Holy shit we all can get arrested here any second

A   A7
I'm telling my friends to act like
D
Everything's cool and nothing happened
D
But I'm pretty fucking sure
D                      A
I don't have two of my fingers

A      A7
Also I think Dennis lost some
D
He's behind me here and I hear him crying
D                             A
Probably we're not going to a wine bar


I don't like songs about trains

There's just too many in my opinion

But goddamn I hope a train

Pulls into this fucking station

And that train has to roll up soon

In like fifteen fucking seconds
