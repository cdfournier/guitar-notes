D         A
I guess I got to get this fucked up thing done
A                     A7
First I have to get a gun
D
From some guy I picked at random
D                    A
Shit he looks like a nice guy

A                            A7
His gun's probably just in a drawer
D
In his little French grocery store
D
Man I could maybe just snag it
D                        A
Without a lot of goddamn drama

A               D            A  E  A
Who knows maybe this will be e-a-s-y
A                   D                A  E  A
And I could have an hour off to feel e-a-s-y

A                                   A7
Cause there's some heavy-duty stuff soon
D
Like breaking into an armed compound
D
Fighting guys in crazy suits
D              A
And probably a dog too

A                               A7
You'd think I could just breeze into
D
This guy's grocery stroll past the chips and
D
Lift his gun then cruise out
D        A
Nice and easy

A                     D                   A  E  A
Maybe I'm fucking crazy but this could be e-a-s-y
A
And in the sweet hour after
A       D         A          E  A  
I could even have beers with my friends

A                                   A7
Probably there's cool wine bars and shit
D
Around here where we can sit
D
And just shoot the breeze about the weather
D               A
And maybe girls respectfully

A                                   A7
I already asked my three friends to meet me
D
Around here cause this is gonna be
D
Easy goddamn it to take this sweet-faced grocer's gun
D                  A
Man he has a sweet face

A A7 D A

A                    D                         A  E  A
Man that shit was so fucked up and sure wasn't e-a-s-y
A                        D        A    E   A
Holy shit we all can get arrested here any second

A                             A7
I'm telling my friends to act like
D
Everything's cool and nothing happened
D
But I'm pretty fucking sure
D                      A
I don't have two of my fingers

A                        A7
Also I think Dennis lost some
D
He's behind me here and I hear him crying
D                             A
Probably we're not going to a wine bar

  D          A           D
I don't like songs about trains
D                A       E  A
There's just too many in my opinion
       D             A
But goddamn I hope a train
      D    A    E       A
Pulls into this fucking station
    D          A              D
And that train has to roll up soon
        A       E       A
In like fifteen fucking seconds
