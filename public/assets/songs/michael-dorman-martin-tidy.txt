A A7 D

D         A
I guess I got to get this fucked up thing done
A7
First I have to get a gun
D
From some guy I picked at random
D                    A
Shit he looks like a nice guy

A         A7
His gun's probably just in a drawer
D
In his little French grocery store
D
Man I could maybe just snag it
D                        A
Without a lot of goddamn drama

    A     D  A  D    A    D  A E A       
Who knows maybe this will be e-a-s-y
    A       D    A  D    A      D    A E A
And I could have an hour off to feel e-a-s-y

D             A
Cause there's some heavy-duty stuff soon
A7
Like breaking into an armed compound
D                A
Fighting guys in crazy suits
A
And probably a dog too

D             A
You'd think I could just breeze into
A7
This guy's grocery stroll past the chips and
D                 A
Lift his gun then cruise out
A
Nice and easy

   A      D   A   D     A   D             A E A
Maybe I'm fucking crazy but this could be e-a-s-y
    A  D   A     D    A
And in the sweet hour after
D       A         D     A       D     A
I could even have beers with my friends

D                A
Probably there's cool wine bars and shit
A7
Around here where we can sit
D
And just shoot the breeze about the weather
D               A
And maybe girls respectfully

D         A
I already asked my three friends to meet me
A7
Around here cause this is gonna be
D                  A
Easy goddamn it to take this sweet-faced grocer's gun
A
Man he has a sweet face

    A    D    A      D      A      D           A E A
Man that shit was so fucked up and sure wasn't e-a-s-y
     A    D      A       D        A    D   A
Holy shit we all can get arrested here any second

D           A
I'm telling my friends to act like
A7
Everything's cool and nothing happened
D
But I'm pretty fucking sure
D            A
I don't have two of my fingers

D      A
Also I think Dennis lost some
A7
He's behind me here and I hear him crying
D                  A
Probably we're not going to a wine bar

  A     D    A     D     A
I don't like songs about trains
A                D          A
There's just too many in my opinion
    A  D      A      D
But goddamn I hope a train
D               A
Pulls into this fucking station
    A    D     A      D       A
And that train has to roll up soon
   A    D  A    D       A
In like fifteen fucking seconds
