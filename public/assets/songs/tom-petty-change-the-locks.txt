              G                D
I changed the lock on my front door
             G         D
So you can't see me anymore
              G              D
And you can't come inside my house
              G              D
And you can't lie down on my couch
              G                D
I changed the lock on my front door

              G            D
I changed the number on my phone
             G             D
So you can't call me up at home
              G                   D
And you can't say those things to me
             G               D
That make me fall down on my knees
              G            D
I changed the number on my phone

                  G             D
Yes I changed the kind of car I drive
             G                D
So you can't see me when I go by
              G               D
And you can't chase me up the street
              G                  D
And you can't knock me off of my feet
              G             D
I changed the kind of car I drive

              G                 D
I changed the kind of clothes I wear
             G          D
So you can't find me anywhere
          G            D
You can't spot me in a crowd
              G                D
And you can't call my name out loud
              G                 D
I changed the kind of clothes I wear

              G                     D
I changed the tracks underneath the train
             G            D
So you can't find me ever again
              G        D
And you can't trace my path
              G       D
And you can't hear me laugh
              G                D
And honey I'm laughing all the time

             G         D
So you can't follow me down
              G             D
And you can't touch me like before
              G                D
And you can't make me want you more
              G            D
