E              C         G
How how can it be that a love
G             E                   C
Carved out of caring fashioned by fate
C            D
Could suffer so hard
D        G                     E    C
From the games played much too often

C          D             G
But making mistakes is a part
G         E
Of life's imperfections
E           C
Born of the years
C     D              G           E
Is it so wrong to be human after all

E              C
Drawn into the stream
   D         E
Of undefined illusion
E             C
Those diamond dreams
C    D                  E
They can't disguise the truth

E                       C
That there is something about you
D       E
Baby so right
E                  C
I wouldn't be here without you
D    E
Baby tonight

E           C        G
If ever our love was concealed
G          E                  C
No one can say that we didn't feel
  D
A million things
D     G                E   C
And a perfect dream of life

C                D
Gone fragile but free
   G             E
We remain tender together
E            C             D
If not so in love it's not so wrong
D          G           E
We're only human after all

E                 C
Oh these changing years
C    D           E
They add to your confusion
E                  C        D
Oh and you need to hear the time
D             E
That told the truth

E                         C
Because there's something about you
D       E
Baby so right
E               C
I couldn't live without you
D    E
Baby tonight

E                      C
And there is something about you
D       E
Baby so right
E               C
I couldn't live without you
D    E
Baby tonight
