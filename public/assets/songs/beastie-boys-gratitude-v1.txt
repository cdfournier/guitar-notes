E
Good times gone and you missed them
A
What's gone wrong in your system
E
Things they bounce like a Spalding
A
What'd you think did you miss your calling
E
It's so free this kind of feeling
A
It's like life it's so appealing
E
When you've got so much to say
E           G         G# A
It's called gratitude     and that's right

E
Good times gone but you feed it
A
Hate's grown strong you feel you need it
E
Just one thing do you know you
A
What you think that the world owes you
E
What's gonna set you free
A
Look inside and you'll see
E
When you've got so much to say
E           G         G# A
It's called gratitude     and that's right
