To catch my breath before I start off again

Driven on without a moment to spend

To pass an evening with a drink and a friend

All those wounds that I can't get unwound

I let my past go too fast

No time to pause if I could slow it all down

Like some captain whose ship runs aground
A                    G                 A
I can wait until the tide comes around

G          D
