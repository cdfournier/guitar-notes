Em              G                  D
It's getting so lonely inside this bed
Em                     G
Don't know if I should lick my wounds
G      D
Or say woe is me instead
Em             G                D
And there's an aching inside my head
Em                     G          D
It's telling me you're better off alone

D         A
But after midnight morning will come
A       C               Bm
And the day will see if you will get some

Bm            Em                       G

Down down down til you see all my dreams
Em                     G                D
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

Em       G                  D
I looked above the other day
Em                G                    D
Cause I think I'm good and ready for a change
Em        G           D
I live my life by the moon
D       Em
If it's high play it low
Em      G
If it's harvest go slow
G           D
And if it's full then go

D         A
But after midnight morning will come
A       C               Bm
And the day will see if you will get some
