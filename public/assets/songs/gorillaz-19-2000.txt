The world is spinning too fast

I'm buying lead Nike shoes
C
To keep myself tethered

To the days I've tried to lose

Stop dancing to the music

There's a monkey in the jungle
     F
Watching a vapor trail
C
Caught up in the conflict
C           G
Between its brain and its tail
G
And if time's elimination
G       F
Then we got nothing to lose
