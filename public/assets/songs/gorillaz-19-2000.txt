The world is spinning too fast
    F
I'm buying lead Nike shoes
C
To keep myself tethered
       G
To the days I've tried to lose
G
My mama said to slow down
         F
You must make your own shoes

Stop dancing to the music
   G
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood

There's a monkey in the jungle
     F
Watching a vapor trail
C
Caught up in the conflict
            G
Between its brain and its tail
G
And if time's elimination
        F
Then we got nothing to lose
C
