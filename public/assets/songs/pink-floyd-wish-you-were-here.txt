C                       D
So so you think you can tell
D           Am
Heaven from hell
Am              G
Blue skies from pain
G                    D
Can you tell a green field
D                 C
From a cold steel rail
C              Am
A smile from a veil
Am                   G
Do you think you can tell

G                   C
Did they get you to trade
C               D
Your heroes for ghosts
D             Am
Hot ashes for trees
Am            G
Hot air for a cool breeze
G                D
Cold comfort for change
D       C
Did you exchange
C                     Am
A walk-on part in the war
Am                   G
For a lead role in a cage

C                              D
How I wish how I wish you were here
D          Am
We're just two lost souls
Am
Swimming in a fish bowl
G
Year after year
D
Running over the same old ground
C
What have we found
C            Am
The same old fears
Am            G
Wish you were here
