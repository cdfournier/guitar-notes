A D - A D

A
I've been drifting along
A      D
In the same stale shoes
A
Loose ends tying a noose
A      D
In the back of my mind

D      A
If you thought that you were making your way
A            D
To where the puzzles and pagans lay
D           A
I'll put it together
A                  D
It's a strange invitation

A D - A D

D      A
When I wake up
A                        D
Someone will sweep up my lazy bones
D   A
And we will
A                       D
Rise in the cool of the evening

D   A
I remember the way that you smiled
A        D
When the gravity shackles were wild
D                A
And something is vacant
A                     D
When I think it's all beginning

A D - A D

A
I've been drifting along
A      D
In the same stale shoes
A
Loose ends tying a noose
A      D
In the back of my mind

D      A
If you thought that you were making your way
A            D
To where the puzzles and pagans lay
D           A
I'll put it together
A                  D
It's a strange invitation
