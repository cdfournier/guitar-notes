Day to day
G            D         G
Where do you want to be
G     D                           G
Cause now you're trying to pick a fight
G                 D   G
With everyone you need

G   D           G
You seem like a soldier
G     D        G
Who's lost his composure
G                  Em                G
You're wounded and playing a waiting game
G           A                     D
In no man's land no one's to blame

D       G             D             G
See the world find an old fashioned girl
G        D                   G
And when all's been said and done
G        E                         G
It's the things that are given not won
G                       D
Are the things that you earned

D           G
Empty handed
G               D         G
Surrounded by a senseless scene
G    D                     G
With nothing of significance
G                     D     G
Besides a shadow of a dream

G   D             G
You sound like an old joke
G   D          G
You want out a bit broke
G             Em            G
And asking me time and time again
G       A                  D
And the answer's still the same

D       G             D             G
See the world find an old fashioned girl
G        D                   G
And when all's been said and done
G        E                         G
It's the things that are given not won
G                       D
Are the things that you earned

You've got a chance to put things right
G                      D
So how's it going to be

D             G
Lay down your arms now
G   D        G
And put us beyond doubt
G                 Em              G
So reach out it's not too far away
G          A                D
Don't mess around now don't delay

D       G             D             G
See the world find an old fashioned girl
G        D                   G
And when all's been said and done

Are given not won
