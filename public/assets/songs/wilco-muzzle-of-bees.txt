A                        G
There's a random painted highway
G               D
And a muzzle of bees
A                    G
My sleeves have come unstitched
G                  D
From climbing your tree

A                                G
When dogs laugh some say they're barking
G                     D
I don't think they're mean
A                  G
Some people get so frightened
G             D
The fences in between

A
The sun gets passed from tree to tree
Em            G       D
Silently then back to me
A
With a breeze blown through
A
Pushed up against the sea
Em      G       D
Finally back to me

A                       G
I'm assuming you got my message
G       D
On your machine
A                G
I'm assuming you love me
G                      D
And you know what that means

A
The sun gets passed from sea to sea
Em           G       D
Silently and back to me
A
With a breeze blown through
A
Pushed up above the leaves
A
With a breeze blowing through
A
My head upon your knee

Em               G       D
Half of it's you half is me

Em               G       D
Half of it's you half is me
