Oh Stylo (Juice)
F              C
Go for blossom in your soul
C                  F
When you know your heart is light
C               F
Electric is the love
C        F
When the mako flies (It's the giant fish)
C                  F
Up from the bottom in your eyes (As it leaps from the stream)
C                  F
Then I'll know the twilight skies (Blood curdles it's a death throw)
C                 F
Are not so broken hearted (Hot from the end of the line)

C                           F
If it's love it's electric
C                              F
It'll be flowing on the streets
C                           F
Night after night
C                           F
Just to get through the week
C                           F
Sometimes it's hard
C                           F
