Oh Stylo (juice)
F              C
Go for blossom in your soul
C                  F
When you know your heart is light
C               F
Electric is the love
C        F
When the mako flies (it's the giant fish)
C                  F
Up from the bottom in your eyes (as it leaps from the stream)
C                  F
Then I'll know the twilight skies (blood curdles it's a death throw)
C                 F
Are not so broken hearted (hot from the end of the line)

C                         F
If it's love it's electric
C                              F
It'll be flowing on the streets
C                   F
  Night after night
C                           F
Just to get through the week
C                   F
Sometimes it's hard
C         F
Right now

Sing yourself (juice)

All recession if I know your heart
C                    F
Electric is the love

In another world in another world in a universe oh
