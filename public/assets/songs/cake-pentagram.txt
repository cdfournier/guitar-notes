G                 C              G
Your pentagram is down below our floor
G                               D
Your naked body shimmers in the night
G                         C           G
Dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite
G                                          D
Your feet are dry with the ashes from dead babies
D        C                         G
Who have passed the test just like all the rest
    D
But never really understood the reasons why
D                   C
They took it in the first place
C               G
Ah in the first place

G                      C            G
Your feisty eyes won't make me fall apart
G                                           D
Your turquoise and silver won't weaken this old heart
     G                         C           G
Yeah dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite
G                                     D
I fell to the ground on a windy windy night
D           C                         G
Well I have passed the test just like all the rest
    D
But never really understood the reasons why
D                C
I took it in the first place
C               G
Ah in the first place
