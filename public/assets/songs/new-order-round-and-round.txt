Em                D                    A
I just can't help thinking what you've done to me
A           Em               D
You built a wall of love and tore it right down
D  A
In front of me

A       Em                    D
And you think you know what's going on
D        A
You keep telling me that I am wrong
Em                 D
I don't care about what you do
D            A
Cause if you mess with me I'll get rid of you

The picture you see
D     G           Em
Is no portrait of me
Em       C          D
It's too real to be shown
D      G           Em
To someone I don't know
Em       C          D
And it's driving me wild
D           G          Em
It makes me act like a child

You think I am crazy but what can I do
A              Em                    D
You waste your time like my money it ain't so funny
D   A
But it's true (don't waste my money baby)

A       Em                   D
Now you can't tell me what's going on
D        A
And that I am weak while you are strong
A    Em                  D
What is it you need that makes your heart bleed
D  A
Do you really know cause it doesn't show
