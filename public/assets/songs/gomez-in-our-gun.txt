    Am                             E
The first words that came could've been more inspired
E           F                  E
You must be hungry or tired or frozen
   Am                          E
So put up your feet throw some coal on the fire
E   F                  E
And weave us a tale of delight

      Am                    E
So we sit in our gun and we wait for our turn
E        F                  E
We'll be waiting all of the night
      Am                    E
So we sit in our gun and we wait for our turn
E        F                  E
We'll be waiting all of our lives

E     C      G
We're all to blame
   C    G
We hide away
C              G              Em         F
Let's take the sand from this bottomless pit
     C       G
It's hell to pay
   C   G
So run away
C          G               Em            F
Destroy on command all who came and then quit

Am E - E F E - Am E - E F E

E         Am                       E
It's been carefully planned by the ones you won't see
E            F                            E
Send out the monkeys they come out of the bushes
   Am                         E
To piss in the punch and then smash up the decks
E         F               E
It's your party we're all obliged

      Am                    E
So we sit in our gun and we wait for our turn
E           F                             E
I think you hurt him there's blood on the floor
      Am                   E
So we sit in our gun can I ask what you're on
E      F                           E
If you made it there's hope for us all

E     C      G
We're all to blame
   C    G
We hide away
C              G              Em         F
Let's take the sand from this bottomless pit
        C      G
There's hell to pay
   C   G
So run away
C          G               Em            F
Destroy on command all who came and then quit
       C       G
You're all the same
   C    G
So hide away
C               G              Em
Let's steal the sand from this bottomless pit
