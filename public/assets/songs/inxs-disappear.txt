Say I'm crying
A                     D
I'm looking at what's on TV
E
Pain and suffering
E       A        D
And the struggle to be free
E
It can't ever be denied
B
And I never will ignore
B          E
But when I see you coming
E
I can take it all

D         E
You're so fine
D       E
Lose my mind
D       E              D       E
And the world seems to disappear
D       E
All the problems
D       E
All the fears
D       E              D       E
And the world seems to disappear

E
Say you're mine
E                 A
And give yourself to the
A        D
Feelings that you know
E                            A
I'm needing all that you can give me
A                   D
All the things that you do so well
E
Words are healing sweet anticipation
B
Making spells as the shadows close in
E
And fall across all our yesterdays

D         E
You're so fine

Lose my mind

E
Say if I could
A         D
Look into myself and reason
E
But I could never never see
   A                 D
Or make sense of the dealings
E
Turn around am I looking at salvation
B
Make me realize all that I am
E
You put the light inside this man
