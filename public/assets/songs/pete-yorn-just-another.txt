C               Am
You and I we're two of a kind
C                           Am
I hate to say it but you'll never relate
           D
What makes you tick
F           C
It makes me smile
C                          Am
You said that I should get away from it all
C                       Am
And bury my head in the sand if I want to
  D        F                C
I think you should thank me now

         F                       Em
You were lying wide awake in the garden
F                       Em
Trying to get over your stardom
F                         Em
And I could never see you depart us
              G
And you're my baby
                    C   Am
You're just another girl

C                      Am
I never mind the way I had to see you
C                          Am                   D      
My working on a day should never explains why I see you
F               C
And I feel your pain
C                      Am
I love to wear my work inside of my head
C                               Am                      D
I can't complain but you should never react the way you did
F           C
I feel your time

You were lying wide awake in the garden

And you're my baby
                    C   Am
You're just another girl
