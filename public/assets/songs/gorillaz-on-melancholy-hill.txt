Up on Melancholy Hill
C                 G
There's a plastic tree
G                 Am
Are you here with me
     F                  G
Just looking out on the day
G          F     G
Of another dream

      C
Where you can't get what you want
C               G
But you can get me
C                   Am
So let's set out to sea
      F              G
Cause you are my medicine
G                    F   G
When you're close to me
G                    C
When you're close to me

So call in the submarines
C                     G
Round the world we'll go
G            Am
Does anybody know
Am       F                  G
If we're looking out on the day
G          F     G
Of another dream
