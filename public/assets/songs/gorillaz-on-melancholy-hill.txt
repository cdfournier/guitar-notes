Up on Melancholy Hill
C                 G
There's a plastic tree
G                 Am
Are you here with me
     F                  G
Just looking out on the day
G          F     G
Of another dream

      C
Where you can't get what you want
C               G
But you can get me
G                   Am
So let's set out to sea
      F              G
Cause you are my medicine
G                    F
When you're close to me
G                      C
  When you're close to me

C - C G - G Am - F G - F G

So calling all submarines
C                     G
Round the world we'll go
G            Am
Does anybody know love
Am       F                  G
If we're looking out on the day
G          F     G
Of another dream

C - C G - G Am

Up on Melancholy Hill
G               Am

Just looking out for the day
G                    F
When you're close to me

  When you're close to me
