D                 E
Green light Seven Eleven
E        G        D
You stop in for a pack of cigarettes
D                          E
You don't smoke don't even want to
G                  D
Hey now check your change

D                 E
Dressed up like a car crash
E    G                             D
Your wheels are turning but you're upside down
E               G                  D
You say when he hits you you don't mind
E               G                  D
Because when he hurts you you feel alive
E     G            D
Oh is that what it is

D               E
Red lights grey morning
E   G                D
You stumble out of a hole in the ground
D              E
A vampire or a victim
E  G                D
It depends on who's around

D                                E
You used to stay in to watch the adverts
E         G                D
You could lip synch to the talk shows
E          G                     D
And if you look you look through me
F#m
And when you talk you talk at me
F#m        G                   A
And when I touch you you don't feel a thing

A          Em                                 D
If I could stay then the night would give you up
Em                              D
Stay and the day would keep its trust
Em                          D
Stay and the night would be enough

D          E
Faraway so close
E           G              D
Up with the static and the radio
D              E
With satellite television
E          G       D
You can go anywhere
D         E
Miami New Orleans
G              D
London Belfast and Berlin

Em                        D
And if you listen I can't call
F#m                            G
And if you jump you just might fall
G                          A
And if you shout I'll only hear you

A          Em                                 D
If I could stay then the night would give you up
Em                              D
Stay and the day would keep its trust
Em                       D
Stay with the demons you drowned
F#m
Stay with the spirit I found
G                           D
Stay and the night would be enough

D                    E
Three o'clock in the morning
E    G             D
It's quiet there's no one around
D                     E
Just the bang and the clatter
E     G             D
As an angel runs to ground
D                     E
Just the bang and the clatter
E     G              D
As an angel hits the ground
