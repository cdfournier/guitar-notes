   A                    E
My makeup is dry and it clags on my chin
    D                      A          E
I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin
    A                         E
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
    D                              A            E
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar

D     Bm    G     C
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
   Bm                     A          E
So let's all drink to the death of a clown

A                        E
Won't someone help me to break up this crown
D                      A          E
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor
D                     A    E
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
    A                     E
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
    D                       A       E
And frantically looking for runaway fleas

D     Bm    G     C
