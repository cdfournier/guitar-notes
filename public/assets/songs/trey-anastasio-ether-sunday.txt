Sunday morning
G              A
Shadows on the shade
D
Yellow dusted fingers bent
D       G           A
Through day old lemonade

D
Sounds of breathing
    G                    A
The birds singing in the trees
D
Beautiful morning
D       G                   A
There's no place I'd rather be

D G A - D G A

D
I sit right down and I rest awhile
G          A
By a shady tree
D
Golden rows of summer
D            G            A
Stretched as far as I can see

D
Sounds of music
    G                   A
Are rippling through my head
D
Hammy's in the kitchen
G                  A
Captain's still in bed

Bm                 G
Cuz life is just a funny dream
    D
And someday
D               G
I'll share this dream with you
Bm        G
  Just to be with you
G           A
This much I pray

A    D   G  A
It's true 
A    D   G  A
It's true 
A    D   G  A
It's true 
A    D   G  A
It's true 

D G A - D G A

Bm             G
Life is just a funny dream
    D
And someday
D               G
I'll share this dream with you
Bm        G
  Just to be with you
G           A
This much I pray

A    D   G  A
It's true 
A    D   G  A
It's true 
A    D   G  A
It's true 
A    D   G  A
It's true
