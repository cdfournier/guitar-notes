  G               C
I declare I don't care no more
G                  C       F       G
I'm burning up and out and growing bored
G     F                 D
In my smoked out boring room

   G                C
My hair is shagging in my eyes
G                   C       F      G
Dragging my feet to hit the street tonight
G        F                     D
To drive along these shit town lights

C               G
I'm not growing up
G        C     F G
I'm just burning out
      C
And I stepped in line
   F                D
To walk amongst the dead

G          C
Apathy has rained on me
G               C      F     G
Now I'm feeling like a soggy dream
G           F                    D
So close to drowning but I don't mind

     G           C
I'll live inside this mental cave
G        C        F      G
Throw my emotions in the grave
G        F          D
Hell who needs them anyway

C               G
I'm not growing up
G        C     F G
I'm just burning out
      C
And I stepped in line
   F                D
To walk amongst the dead

C               G
I'm not growing up
G        C     F G
I'm just burning out
      C
And I stepped in line
   F                D
To walk amongst the dead
