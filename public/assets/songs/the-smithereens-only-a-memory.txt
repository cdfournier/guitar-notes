   A       G           D           E
My mind is filled with thoughts of you
  A     G         D       E
I think about the days of two
  A          G        D          E
I search the room but you're not there
     A       G       D    E
Your perfume lingers everywhere but it's

F      E
Only a memory
   F                 G
Of what our love was going to be
D      E
Only a memory
F              G
Broken bits of you and me
D      E     F
Only a memory
F      G     D
Only a memory

     A        G      D       E
In a world of pain I have no peer
    A    G        D    E
You fade away and disappear
    A     G       D         E
And now I have to learn the game
      A      G       D         E
Where no one wins or takes the blame but it's

F      E
Only a memory
   F                 G
Of what our love was going to be
D      E
Only a memory
F               G
Now that we are history
D      E
Only a memory
F      G     D
Only a memory

But it's
F      E
Only a memory

Of what our love was going to be

    A         G         D E
Why should it matter if I cry
  A    G         D      E
I sit around and wonder why
    A      G        D       E
Now I feel much too weak to live
    A        G       D       E
And I've got nothing left to give now it's

F      E
Only a memory

Of what our love was going to be
D      E
Only a memory

Only a memory
