E    G                A      G
They say they got the 40 cal Glok

E           G      A               G
Ranting and raving claiming you're armed
E    G            A             G

And things are gettin kinda whacked

E      G              A          G
If you can't live the lie let it die
E          G            A            G
And if you can't live a life full of strife
E        G        A            G

He changed his mind once the crack in his head bled
E         G          A       G
Movin and shakin the brittle illusion
E         G              A          G
Referring concurring and workin out solutions

E      G              A          G
