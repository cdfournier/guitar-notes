Before you get out you Town Car

G           A      G               E
Ranting and raving claiming you're armed

And things are gettin kinda whacked

       E              G          A   G
If you can't live the lie let it die
           E            G            A     G
And if you can't live a life full of strife

Mucho dinero the man with the hat said
E              G             A            G
He changed his mind once the crack in his head bled
E         G          A       G
Movin and shakin the brittle illusion
E         G              A      G
Referring concurring and workin solutions

       E              G          A   G
