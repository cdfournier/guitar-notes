A A7 D A - A E

A           A7
Love rescue me
     D                  A
Come forth and speak to me
A
Raise me up
A                E
And don't let me fall
   A         A7
No man is my enemy
       D              A
My own hands imprison me
A    E      A
Love rescue me

A                     A7
Many strangers have I met
       D          A
On the road to my regret
A                                        E
Many lost who seek to find themselves in me
     A         A7
They ask me to reveal
    D                        A
The very thoughts they would conceal
A    E      A
Love rescue me

        D          A
And the sun in the sky
        D                 A
Makes a shadow of you and I
           D          A                E
Stretching out as the sun sinks in the sea

    A              A7
I'm here without a name
       D            A
In the palace of my shame
A           E      A
I said love rescue me

A                       A7
In the cold mirror of a glass
  D                 A
I see my reflection pass
A                                       E
I see the dark shades of what I used to be
          A             A7
I see the purple of her eyes
    D             A
The scarlet of my lies
A    E      A
Love rescue me

E
Yeah though I walk
       A
In the valley of the shadow
E                  A
Yet I will fear no evil

       A                  A7
I have cursed thy rod and staff
        D              A
They no longer comfort me
A    E      A
Love rescue me

A A7 D A - A E
Sha la la la
       A         E      A
I said love love rescue me

         A              A7
Yeah I'm here without a name
       D            A
In the palace of my shame
A           E      A
I said love rescue me

     A            A7
I've conquered my past
    D                 A
The future is here at last
  A            A7
I stand at the entrance
     E
To a new world I can see
    A            A7
The ruins to the right of me
     D              A
Will soon have lost sight of me
A    E      A
Love rescue me
