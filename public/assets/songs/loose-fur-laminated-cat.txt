Springtime comes and the leaves are back on the trees again
E                                A
The snipers are harder to see my friend
A                E
Weeding out your weekends
E
Summer comes the gravity undoes you
E
You're happy because of the lovely way
E            A
The sunshine bends
A
Hiding in the deep end
A                E
Weeding out your weekend

A                    E
Candy left over from Halloween
A                     E
The Unified theory of everything
A                          E
Love left over from lovers leaving
A                           E
Books they all know they're not worth reading
A                   E
  They're not worth reading

E
When autumn comes you sit in your chair
E                       A
And you stare at the TV square
A
Hiding all your feelings
A                E
Weeding out your weekends

E
When winter comes and the days all start late
E
There's motion on the boughs
E                     A
Where the dark shapes prowl
A
Feeling all your feelings
A              E
Feeling out of feelings

A                    E
Candy left over from Halloween
A                     E
The Unified theory of everything
A                          E
Love left over from lovers leaving
A                           E
Books they all know they're not worth reading
A                       E
 It's not for the season
