Em Am C G

Em
They were strolling in the gloaming
          Am
Where the roses were in bloom
  C                                    G
A soldier and his sweetheart brave and true
          Em
And their hearts were filled with sorrow
          Am
For their thoughts were of tomorrow
   C                                  G
As she pinned a rose upon his coat of blue

       C
Do not ask me love to linger
         Am
When you know not what to say
    G                                 Em
For duty calls your sweetheart's name again
         C
And your heart need not be sighing
   Am
If I be among the dying
        G                 C           G
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again

Em
When the roses bloom again
Am
Beside the river
    C                                  G
And the mockingbird has sung his sweet refrain
       Em
In the days of auld lang syne
        Am
I'll be with you sweetheart mine
        C                             G
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again

Em
Mid the rattle of the battle
       Am
Came a whisper soft and low
  C                             G
A soldier who had fallen in the fray
     Em
I am dying I am dying
      Am
And I know I'll have to go
              C
But I want to tell you
              G
Before I pass away

          C
There's a far and distant river
          Am
Where the roses are in bloom
  G                                   Em
A sweetheart who is waiting there for me
         C
And it's there I pray you take me
     Am
I've been faithful don't forsake me
        G                 C           G
I'll be with her when the roses bloom again
