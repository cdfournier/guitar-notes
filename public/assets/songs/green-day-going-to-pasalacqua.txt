E D A

           E
Here we go again
E                   D
Infatuation touches me
D                                 A
Just when I thought that it would end
A           E
Oh but then again it seems much more than that but
D                                A
I'm not sure exactly what you're thinking

A      D                 A
Well I toss and turn all night
A           E
Thinking of your ways of affection
E      D                               A
But to find that it's not different at all
A      D             A
Well I throw away my past mistakes
A   E 
And contemplate my future
E           D
That's when I say
D        A
What the heck

A             E
Would it last forever
E         F#
You and I together
F#
Hand and hand
F#     D         A
We run away (far away)
A                E
I'm in for nasty weather
E             F#
But I'll take whatever you can
F#                 D        A
Give that comes my way (far away)
