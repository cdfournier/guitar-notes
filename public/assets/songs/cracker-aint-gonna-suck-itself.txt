       D          E                A
Virgin Records it ain't gonna suck itself
                               E
I say baby it ain't gonna suck itself
         D              E                A
What you waiting for it ain't gonna suck itself

       E
Well I flew out from Virginie on the very first day
           A
I heard my record company exercise my pay to play
        E
Went to see Mr Lott but his assistant said no
A
Security will escort you to the parking lot
       D
It was 102 degrees I was feeling kind of hot
     A
So I walked across the street for one of those Mexican frozen popsicles
         E
Couldn't buy just one so I bought myself a box
            A
When I come back the assistant she's standing in the parking lot
   E
No hard feelings do you want one of these
        A
But she looks at me like I was speaking Chinese
    E
The security man walks up he helps himself to one
             A
Coincidently Chinese and hot from standing in the sun
     D
Then he helps himself to another he puts it in her hand
        A
But she looks at it like it was a piece of crap
     E
Or a dead and dying bird she didn't understand
E
So I was just trying to be helpful when I said

A                        E
Baby it ain't gonna suck itself
          D          E                A
Oh Virgin Records it ain't gonna suck itself
                                                     E
Just so we're not totally sexist it ain't gonna lick itself
          D          E                A
Ah Virgin Records it ain't gonna suck itself

         E
Well I'm standing in the parking lot waiting on my ride
            A
His name is Jackson Haring and he's still inside
           E
He went in through mailroom for some record company swag
         A
But this Virgin Records there ain't shit to be had
        D
And the halls they was empty because everyone was laid off
       A
And he took a wrong turn ends up in the tape vault
     E
Only one thing to do when you're standing face to face
         A
With the Sticky Fingers Let It Be master tapes
              E
You've got to stick them in the satchel and head on the down the hall
       A
Saying these will go nicely with that Residents eyeball
     E
Many years ago while working for Bill Graham Presents
       A
A prop eyeball was stolen backstage from The Residents
        D
And the rumor went around that Jackson was the thief
           A
But that's neither here nor there and I was sitting in the jeep
        E
Looking at the Sticky Fingers master tapes
E
My popsicle's dripping on the seat so I throw it out the window and it lands at the feet of Roy Lott

       A                    E
Hey Roy it ain't gonna suck itself
          D          E                A
