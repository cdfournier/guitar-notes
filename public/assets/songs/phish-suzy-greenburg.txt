Little Suzy Greenberg with her head caved in
D              C                 G
Soon to let me drown beneath the undertow
D                   C          G
You better put that woman in a loony bin
D                  C                   G
Cause you know I'd really like to be a part of her show

Suzy is an artist she paints quite a lot
C                 A        D

Suzy's bout as faithful as a slot machine
D                  C              G
Pays off once in a while then she robs you clean
D            C                     G
She's always afraid that she's not sure what she's worth
D                C              G
She's out of her mind and she's not on this earth

C                   A                      D
The woman walks the streets like she's the queen of the town
C                 A               D
Doesn't talk very much she's very profound
C           A                  D
Little Suzy Greenberg's always playing a game
C               A              G
But today I bet she's probably forgotten my name
