G D Am G

G       D               Am
  Drove downtown in the rain
Am                       G
Nine-thirty on a Tuesday night
G       D                        Bm        Am
Just to check out the late-night    record shop
G         D                 Am
  Call it impulsive call it compulsive call it insane
G              D                       Bm Am
  But when I'm surrounded I just can't    stop

G                  D                         Am
  It's a matter of instinct it's a matter of conditioning
Am
A matter of fact
G         D                Bm Am
  You can call me Pavlov's    dog
G        D             Am
  Ring a bell and I'll salivate how'd you like that
G     D                    Bm             Am
  Dr. Landy tell me you're not just a pedagogue
Am
Because right now I'm

G          D             Am
  Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did
Am       G        D                   Em
Well I'm lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did


G        D          Am                          G
  So I'm lying here just staring at the ceiling tiles
G       D              Bm               Am
And I'm thinking about oh what to think about
G      D                Am                  G
  Just listening and re-listening to Smiley Smile
G       D                    Bm           Am
And I'm wondering if this is some kind of creative drought
Am
Because I'm

G          D             Am
  Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did
Am       G        D                   Em
Well I'm lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did

Am                   D               F          Em
  And if you want to find me I'll be out in the sandbox
Am               D                      G        F Am 
  Just wondering where the hell all the love has gone
Am             D                   F              Em
I'm playing my guitar and building castles in the sun
Em          D               G
Whoa-oh and singing Fun Fun Fun

G          D             Am
  Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did
Am       G        D                   Em
Well I'm lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did

Am  Em    Am               Em            Am
  I had a dream that I was three hundred pounds
Am  Em                Am
And though I was very heavy
  Em            Am               Em
I floated til I couldn't see the ground
  Em            Am               Em
I floated til I couldn't see the ground

Am                Em
Somebody help me (I couldn't see the ground)
Am                Em
Somebody help me (I couldn't see the ground)
Am            E
Somebody help me
E
Because I'm

  Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did
Am       G        D                   Em
Well I'm lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did

G       D               Am
  Drove downtown in the rain
Am                       G
Nine-thirty on a Tuesday night
G       D                        Bm        Am
Just to check out the late-night    record shop
Am                 G
(Gate night record shop)
G       D                 Am
Call it impulsive call it compulsive call it insane
G              D                       Bm Am
  But when I'm surrounded I just can't    stop
