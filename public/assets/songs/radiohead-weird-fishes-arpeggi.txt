Em
In the deepest ocean
    F#m
The bottom of the sea
     A
Your eyes
     G
They turn me

Em
Why should I stay here
F#m               A  G
Why should I stay

I'd be crazy not to follow
       F#m
Follow where you lead
     A
Your eyes
     G
They turn me

Em
Turn me into phantoms (way out)
     F#m
I follow to the edge (way out)
       A
Of the earth (way out)
    G
And fall off

     Em
Yeah everybody leaves (way out)
   F#m
If they get the chance (way out)
    A
And this (way out)
      G
Is my chance

A
I get eaten by the worms
A         G
And weird fishes
A
Picked over by the worms
A         G
And weird fishes
G     A
Weird fishes
A     G
Weird fishes
