E                         F#m
Put your hands on the wheel
F#m     A          E    F#m A
Let the golden age begin
E             F#m
The window down
F#m      A                 E   F#m A
Feel the moonlight on your skin

E                 F#m
Let the desert wind
A                E   F#m A
Cool your aching head
E                          F#m
Let the weight of the world
A            E    F#m A
Drift away instead

D   A  F#m          A          E  F#m
Ohh    these days I barely get by
A            E  F#m A
I don't even try

E                     F#m
It's a treacherous road
A                E   F#m A
With a desolated view
E                    F#m
There's distant lights
A                        E  F#m A
But here they're far and few

E                 F#m
The sun don't shine
A              E  F#m A
Even when it's day
E                       F#m
You gotta drive all night
A                        E   F#m A
Just to feel like you're okay

D   A  F#m          A          E  F#m
Ohh    these days I barely get by
A            E  F#m A
I don't even try
A            E  F#m A
I don't even try
