    G              C              G    D
I'm sitting by the window of your 32nd floor apartment
G                C                  D
Waiting for your phone calls all to end
    G                C
I'm sitting watching wind blow
         G                D
Watching time go watching cars go by
    G                 C           D
I'm waiting for these memories to begin

   G          C
If I threw my guitar
        G             D
Out the window so far down
      G          C
Would I start to regret it
   G
Or would I smile
    D               G    C    D
And watch it slowly fall fall fall


G                  C
Garbage trucks and taxi cabs
      G                  D
Don't seem like they can reach me here
    G                     C        D
The clamor of jackhammers seems so faint
         G
Well the way you treat me
C             G                  D
Like the only slightly brings me down a lot
  G                     C           D
I don't think that I'll ever be the same

   G          C
If I threw my guitar
        G             D
Out the window so far down
      G          C
Would I start to regret it
   G
Or would I smile
    D               G    C    D
And watch it slowly fall fall fall
