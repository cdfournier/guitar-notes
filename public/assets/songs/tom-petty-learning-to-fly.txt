G      F       C  Am G
Well I started out
G      F     C   Am G
Down a dirty road
F       C  Am G
Started out
F   C    Am G
All alone

G       F        C   Am G
And the sun went down
G    F           C   Am G
As I crossed the hill
G       F    C   Am G
And the town lit up
G   F         C   Am G
The world got still

G   F           C   Am G
I'm learning to fly
G     F         C   Am G
But I ain't got wings
F      C   Am G
Coming down
G      F       C   Am G
Is the hardest thing

G        F        C   Am G
Well the good old days
F       C    Am G
May not return
G       F           C   Am G
And the rocks might melt
G       F       C   Am G
And the sea may burn

G   F           C   Am G
I'm learning to fly (I'm learning to fly)
G     F         C   Am G
But I ain't got wings (I'm learning to fly)
G   F      C   Am G
And coming down (I'm learning to fly)
G      F       C   Am G
Is the hardest thing (I'm learning to fly)

G   F        C   Am G
Now some say life
G    F        C   Am G
Will beat you down
G    F          C   Am G
Yeah break your heart
F          C   Am G
Steal your crown

G    F       C  Am G
So I started out
G   F         C   Am G
For God knows where
G F          C   Am G
I guess I'll know
G      F   C   Am G
When I get there

G   F           C   Am G
I'm learning to fly
F          C    Am G
Around the clouds
G   F         C  Am G
But what goes up
F         C   Am G
Must come down

G   F           C   Am G
I'm learning to fly (I'm learning to fly)
G     F         C   Am G
But I ain't got wings
F      C   Am G
Coming down
G      F       C   Am G
Is the hardest thing

G   F           C   Am G
I'm learning to fly (I'm learning to fly)
F          C    Am G
Around the clouds
G   F         C  Am G
But what goes up (I'm learning to fly)
F         C   Am G
Must come down
G   F           C   Am G
I'm learning to fly (I'm learning to fly)
G    F           C   Am G
(I'm learning to fly)
G   F           C   Am G
I'm learning to fly (I'm learning to fly)
G    F           C   Am G
(I'm learning to fly)
G    F           C   Am G
(I'm learning to fly)
