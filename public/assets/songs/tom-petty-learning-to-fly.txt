       F       C  Am G
Well I started out
       F     C   Am G
Down a dirty road
F       C  Am G
Started out
F   C    Am G
All alone

        F        C   Am G
And the sun went down
     F           C   Am G
As I crossed the hill
        F    C   Am G
And the town lit up
    F         C   Am G
The world got still

    F           C   Am G
I'm learning to fly
      F         C   Am G
But I ain't got wings
F      C   Am G
Coming down
       F       C   Am G
Is the hardest thing

         F        C   Am G
Well the good old days
F       C    Am G
May not return
        F           C   Am G
And the rocks might melt
        F       C   Am G
And the sea may burn

    F           C   Am G
I'm learning to fly (I'm learning to fly)
      F         C   Am G
But I ain't got wings (I'm learning to fly)
    F      C   Am G
And coming down (I'm learning to fly)
       F       C   Am G
Is the hardest thing (I'm learning to fly)

    F        C   Am G
Now some say life
     F        C   Am G
Will beat you down
     F          C   Am G
Yeah break your heart
F          C   Am G
Steal your crown

     F       C  Am G
So I started out
    F         C   Am G
For God knows where
  F          C   Am G
I guess I'll know
       F   C   Am G
When I get there

    F           C   Am G
I'm learning to fly
F          C    Am G
Around the clouds
    F         C  Am G
But what goes up
F         C   Am G
Must come down

    F           C   Am G
I'm learning to fly (I'm learning to fly)
      F         C   Am G
But I ain't got wings
F      C   Am G
Coming down
       F       C   Am G
Is the hardest thing

    F           C   Am G
I'm learning to fly (I'm learning to fly)
F          C    Am G
Around the clouds
    F         C  Am G
But what goes up (I'm learning to fly)
F         C   Am G
Must come down
    F           C   Am G
I'm learning to fly (I'm learning to fly)
     F           C   Am G
(I'm learning to fly)
    F           C   Am G
I'm learning to fly (I'm learning to fly)
     F           C   Am G
(I'm learning to fly)
     F           C   Am G
(I'm learning to fly)
