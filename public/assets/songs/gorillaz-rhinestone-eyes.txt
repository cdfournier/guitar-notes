Am G

Am                   G
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
Am                 G
That you made with plastic power
Am              G
Your rhinestone eyes are like
Em
Factories far away

Am                                G
When the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Am               G
Drive on engines til they weep
Am          G         Em
With future pixels in factories far away

Am                   G
So call the mainland from the beach
Am                     G
All parties now washed up in bleach
Am            G          Em
The waves are rising for this time of year

Am                       G
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Am                    G
Under sunshine pylons we'll meet
Am            G
While rain is falling like
Em
Rhinestones from the sky

Am Em - Am Em - Am Em - Am Em

Am                     G
I can't see you now my heart is frozen
Am             G
All the bowses and the growses
Am        G         Em
Have been abstinated in my soul

Am                G
I prayed on the immovable
    Am              G
Yet clinging to the atoms of rock
Am          G           Em
Seasons the adjustments signs of change

Am                  G
I can't see now she said taxi
Am                G
Now that light is all I can take
Am               G            Em
This dawn brings strange loyalties and skies

Am                   G
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
Am                 G
That you made with plastic power
Am              G
Your rhinestone eyes are like
Em
Factories far away (here we go again)

Am Em - Am Em - Am Em - Am Em
That's electric-tric-tric-tric-tric
Am Em - Am Em - Am Em - Am Em
That's electric-tric-tric-tric-tric

Am              G
Helicopters fly over the beach
Am              G
Same time every day same routine
Am                  G
  A clear target in the summer when
Em
Skies are blue

Am                          G
It's part of the noise when winter comes
   Am                 G
It reverberates in my lungs
Am         G
Nature's corrupted in
Em
Factories far away (here we go again)

Am Em - Am Em - Am Em - Am Em
That's electric-tric-tric-tric-tric
Your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky

Am Em - Am Em - Am Em - Am Em
That's electric-tric-tric-tric-tric
With future pixels in factories far away (here we go again)
