Am G

Am                   G
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
Am                 G
That you made with plastic power
Am
Your rhinestone eyes are like
G             Em
Factories far away

Am                                G
When the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Am                   G
Drive on engines til they weep
Am                    G             Em
With future pixels in factories far away

Am                   G
So call the mainland from the beach
Am                     G
All parties now washed up in bleach
Am                       G
The waves are rising for this time of year
Am                       G
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Am                    G
Under sunshine pylons we'll meet
Am            G
While rain is falling like
A                    Am
Rhinestones from the sky

Dm Am - Dm Am - Em Am - Em Am

Am                     A
I can't see you now my heart is frozen
Am                     A
All the verses and the corrosion
Am                     A
Have been after native in my soul

Am                A
I prayed on the immovable
Am                  A
Yet clinging to the atoms of rock
Am                     A
Seasons see adjustment signs of change

Am                       A
I can't see now she said taxi
Am                      A
Now that light is all I can take
Am                       A
This dawn brings strange loyalties and skies

Am                   G
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
Am                 G
That you made with plastic power
Am
Your rhinestone eyes are like
G             Em
Factories far away (here we go again)

Am                       A
Helicopters fly over the beach
Am                       A
Same time every day same routine
Am                    A
A clear target in the summer when skies are blue

Am                          A
It's part of the noise when winter comes
Am                    A
It reverberates in my lungs
G
Nature's corrupted in
G             Em
Factories far away (here we go again)
