C D G Em

C D G Em - C D G Em

Em        C        D
I used to rule the world
D          G                    Em
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Em                   C     D
Now in the morning I sleep alone
D         G                 Em
Sweep the streets I used to own

C D G Em - C D G Em

Em        C        D
I used to roll the dice
D        G                  Em
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Em            C           D
Listen as the crowd would sing
D       G                     Em
Now the old king is dead long live the king

Em           C        D
One minute I held the key
D        G                    Em
Next the walls were closed on me
Em                       C       D
And I discovered that my castles stand
D    G                   Em
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

  C              D
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
G             Em
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
C               D
Be my mirror my sword and shield
   G                 Em
My missionaries in a foreign field
C                 D
For some reason I can't explain
G                         Em
Once you'd gone there was never
Em       C      D
Never an honest word
D            Bm               Em
And that was when I ruled the world

C D G Em - C D G Em

Em                  C    D
It was a wicked and wild wind
D             G               Em
Blew down the doors to let me in
Em                        C        D
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
D      G                         Em
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Em       C      D
Revolutionaries wait
D      G                Em
For my head on a silver plate
Em                 C      D
Just a puppet on a lonely string
D  G                         Em
Oh who would ever want to be king

  C              D
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
G             Em
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
C               D
Be my mirror my sword and shield
   G                 Em
My missionaries in a foreign field
C                 D
For some reason I can't explain
G                         Em
Once you'd gone there was never
Em       C      D
Never an honest word
D            Bm               Em
And that was when I ruled the world

C D G Em - C D G Em

   C     D  G  Em
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh oh
   C     D  G  Em
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh oh

  C              D
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
G             Em
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
C               D
Be my mirror my sword and shield
   G                 Em
My missionaries in a foreign field
C                 D
For some reason I can't explain
  G                      Em
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Em       C      D
Never an honest word
D            Bm               Em
But that was when I ruled the world
