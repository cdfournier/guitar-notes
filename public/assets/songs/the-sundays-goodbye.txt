  A             B      E
I vow that it's goodbye
  A             B           E
I vow that it's goodbye and God bless
A                   B
Why did you have to assume
      E
We're exactly the same
      A
Oh no no
A          B             E
Talk about yourself self self

  A             B              E
I vow that it's goodbye to the old ways
      A              B
Those stories were a good read
B         E
They were dumb as well
A                B
I could never be seen
        E
Falling down on my knees crawling
      A
Oh no no
A           B          E
Talk about a sell sell sell

A
Oh let the heavens shudder baby
B           E
I belong to you
E       A
Oh they said you get what you deserve
    B                 E
And all they said was true

E     A                   B
So is this what it's come to
     C#m                       E
Am I cold or just a little bit warm
   A                         B
Oh well just give me an easy life
B              E
And a peaceful death
Yeah yeah
