C                G                 D    A
You don't know a thing about their lives
C                   G                D    A
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
C                G                 D    A
You shake as you think of how they sleep
A       C               G               D   A
But you write as if you all lie side by side

A#          Am
Reader meet Author
Am       G               C
With the hope of hearing sense
C       A#             Am
But you may be feeling let down
Am     G        C
By the words of defense
C       F           C              D  G
He says no one ever sees me when I cry

C                G                 D    A
You don't know a thing about their lives
C                G                         D    A
Books don't save them books aren't stanley knives
A        C               G    D     A
And if a fight broke out here tonight
A     C                G                    D   A
You'd be the first away because you're that type

A       A#       Am             G             C
And the year two thousand won't change anyone here
C       A#             Am
As each fabled promise flies so fast
Am     G                  C
You'll swear it was never there
C           F                   C           D   G
Oh have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life

   A#               Am
So safely with your software
G                    C
Miles from the front line
    A#                 Am
You hear the way their sad voice sings
Am      G                C
And you start to imagine things
   F             G          D   G
Oh any excuse to write more lies

Am D# A# F Am
