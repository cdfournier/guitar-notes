G  C              F             C       G
Is it all in that pretty little head of yours
          C          F            C   G
What goes on in that place in the dark
       C              F          C          G
Well I used to know a girl and I could have sworn
         F        G      C
That her name was Veronica

G           C              F        C           G
Oh well she used to have a carefree mind of her own
      C        F           C  G
And a delicate look in her eye
      C    F          C              G
These days I'm afraid she's not even sure
       F       G      C
If her name is Veronica

C      D
Do you suppose that waiting hands on eyes
D            G
Veronica has gone to hide
D
And all the time she laughs at those
D                      G
Who shout her name and steal her clothes
F        F#m

Do the days drag by did the favors wane
       C             F            C   G
Did he roam down the town all the while
         C              F            C           G
Will you wake from your dream with a wolf at the door
         F       G      C
Reaching out for Veronica

G       C          F          C     G
Well it was all of sixty-five years ago
         C             F                C    G
When the world was the street where she lived
      C         F           C           G
And a young man sailed on a ship in the sea
       F          G      C
With a picture of Veronica

C      Am         F
On the Empress of India
F          A#                       C
And as she closed her eyes upon the world
    Am                                   F
And picked upon the bones of last week's news
    A
She spoke his name out loud again

C      D
Do you suppose that waiting hands on eyes
D            G
Veronica has gone to hide
D
And all the time she laughs at those
D                      G
Who shout her name and steal her clothes

Veronica sits in her favorite chair
    C         F         C    G
She sits very quiet and still
         C          F              C         G
And they call her a name that they never get right
       F               G      C
And if they don't then nobody else will

G       C              F        C           G
But she used to have a carefree mind of her own
       C        F           C  G
With a devilish look in her eye
       C       F       C            G
Saying you can call me anything you like
       F       G      C
But my name is Veronica

Do you suppose that waiting hands on eyes
D            G
Veronica has gone to hide
