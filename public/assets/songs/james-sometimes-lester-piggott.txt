G
There's a storm outside and the gap between crack and thunder
Em                   C             G
Crack and thunder is closing in is closing in
G                                                        Em
The rain floods gutters and makes a great sound on concrete
G                                                        Em
On a flat roof there's a boy leaning against the wall of rain
Em          C                            G
Aerial held high calling come on thunder come on thunder

G         Em                       C
Sometimes when I look deep in your eyes
C                      G
I swear I can see your soul
G         Em                       C
Sometimes when I look deep in your eyes
C                      G
I swear I can see your soul

G
It's a monsoon and the rain lifts lids off cars
Em                  C                      G
Spinning buses like toys stripping them to chrome
G                                                   Em
Across the bay the waves are turning into something else
Em                           C                   G
Picking up fishing boats and spewing them on the shore

G                                     Em     C                G
The boy is hit lit up against the sky like a sign like a neon sign
G                              Em          C            G
And he crumples drops into the gutter cuts strange legs twitching
G                                Em              C              G
The flood swells his clothes and delivers him on delivers him on

G         Em                       C
Sometimes when I look deep in your eyes
C                      G
I swear I can see your soul
G         Em                       C
Sometimes when I look deep in your eyes
C                      G
I swear I can see your soul

G                              Em                          C        G
There's four new colors in the rainbow an old man's taking Polaroids
G                      Em           C            G
But all he captures is endless rain endless rain endless rain
G                       Em                      C
He says listen takes my head and puts my ear to his
C                          G
And I swear I can hear the sea

G         Em                       C
Sometimes when I look deep in your eyes
C                      G
I swear I can see your soul
G         Em                       C
Sometimes when I look deep in your eyes

I swear I can see your soul

I swear I can see your soul

I swear I can see your soul

G         Em                       C
Sometimes when I look deep in your eyes
