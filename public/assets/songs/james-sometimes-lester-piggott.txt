G
There's a storm outside and the gap between crack and thunder
Em                   C             G
Crack and thunder is closing in is closing in
G
The rain floods gutters and makes a great sound on concrete
G                                                        Em
On a flat roof there's a boy leaning against the wall of rain
Em          C                            G
Aerial held high calling come on thunder come on thunder

G         Em
Sometimes when I look deep in your eyes
  C                    G
I swear I can see your soul
G         Em
Sometimes when I look deep in your eyes
  C                    G
I swear I can see your soul

G
It's a monsoon and the rain lifts lids off cars
Em                  C                      G
Spinning buses like toys stripping them to chrome
G                                                   Em
Across the bay the waves are turning into something else
Em         C                                     G
Picking up fishing boats and spewing them on the shore

G
The boy is hit lit up against the sky like a sign like a neon sign
Em              C                     G
And he crumples drops into the gutter cuts strange legs twitching
G         Em         C                           G
The flood swells his clothes and delivers him on delivers him on

G         Em
Sometimes when I look deep in your eyes
  C                    G
I swear I can see your soul
G         Em
Sometimes when I look deep in your eyes
  C                    G
I swear I can see your soul

G
There's four new colors in the rainbow an old man's taking Polaroids
Em                     C                         G
But all he captures is endless rain endless rain endless rain
G                                               Em
He says listen takes my head and puts my ear to his
Em    C                    G
And I swear I can hear the sea

G         Em
Sometimes when I look deep in your eyes
  C                    G
I swear I can see your soul
G         Em
Sometimes when I look deep in your eyes
  C                    G
I swear I can see your soul

G         Em
Sometimes when I look deep in your eyes
  C                    G
I swear I can see your soul

Sometimes when I look deep in your eyes
  C                    G
I swear I can see your soul
