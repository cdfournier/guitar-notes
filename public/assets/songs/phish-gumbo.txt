Em

          Em
There's a mouse staring out of the window
    A
His car is trapped in the snow
     D
He's planning a family vacation
       Em
But he just can't go

Em
Around the next corner's a rare bird
    A
His feathers are trapped in a sling
A         D
He's been trashed by some gunslinging parrot
      Em
Who's jealous he ain't got no grin

Em
There ain't no time to stash the gumbo
   A
Or rattle around in a cage
    D
The sacrificed child's made bubbles
    Em
And spittle is everywhere in rage
Em
In the hot sand I render my feet
        A
They're blistered and caked with debris
D
Chez Rolez is guarding the tote board
      Em
While Angry piddles with glee

Em
There's a fool writing no more's on sandpaper
     A
He's sending them off to himself
   D
He gets them a couple days later
    Em
Who put them along his top shelf

Em
We could get tired of shavings
    A
And carve up a good hunk of wood
D
Remembering to check on the sausage
D        Em
He's got cooking somewhere but good

Em
There ain't no time to stash the gumbo
   A
Or rattle around in a cage
    D
The sacrificed child's made bubbles
    Em
And spittle is everywhere in rage
Em
In the hot sand I render my feet
        A
They're blistered and caked with debris
D
Chez Rolez is guarding the tote board
      Em
While Angry piddles with glee

Em A D Em - Em A D Em - Em A D Em - Em A D Em

There ain't no time to stash the gumbo
Or rattle around in a cage
The sacrificed child's made bubbles
And spittle is everywhere in rage
In the hot sand I render my feet
They're blistered and caked with debris
Chez Rolez is guarding the tote board
While Angry piddles with glee

Em
There ain't no time to stash the gumbo
