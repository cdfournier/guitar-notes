Em
Come a little bit closer
Em                  D
Hear what I have to say
Em
Just like children sleeping
Em                        D
We could dream this night away

G
But there's a full moon rising
G                       D
Let’s go dancing in the light
G
We know where the music's playing
G                         D
Let’s go out and feel the night

A
Because I'm still in love with you
A
I want to see you dance again
A
Because I'm still in love with you
A               D
On this harvest moon

Em
When we were strangers
Em                 D
I watched you from afar
Em
When we were lovers
Em                      D
I loved you with all my heart

G
But now it's getting late
G                        D
And the moon is climbing high
G
I want to celebrate
G                      D
See it shining in your eye

A
Because I'm still in love with you
A
I want to see you dance again
A
Because I'm still in love with you
A               D
On this harvest moon

Because I'm still in love with you
A               D
On this harvest moon
