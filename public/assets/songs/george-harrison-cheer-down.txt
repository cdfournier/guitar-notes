      D
I can see by your grin
            C         G
That you're trembling within
     D        C          G
It's all over town cheer down

        D
And the smile on your face
   C                G
Is sometimes out of place
      D       G     A      D
Don't mind no frowns cheer down

G                   D
If your hair should fall
G                     D
If your shares should crash
G                  D                 A
You'll get by even without getting a rash

           D
There's no tears to be shed
          C        G
I'm gonna love you instead
  D        G     A      D   G
I want you around cheer down

G                    D
When your teeth drop out
G                  D                A
You'll get by even without taking a bite

        D
If your iPhone is dead
          C        G
I'm gonna love you instead

The world loves a clown cheer down

I want you around cheer down
