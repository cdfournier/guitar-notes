They try to move us to use us
A                      D
Like Judas to Jesus to please us

Diverting the issues to misuse the peoples

When the wingtips got it locked up

Ya dig it the fucking wingtips did it

But some of us are wise and some of us are suckers

The same damn story and a sequel
  D
I thought I fought for what was right
           A                      D
But in the end my friend 20-20 is hindsight

A
And I can't get with that
