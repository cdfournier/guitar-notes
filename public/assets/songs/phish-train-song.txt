G
All the way home we felt we had a chance
G                                   A
To review the coulds before we were born
D                           G
And to invite a new game of can'ts

G
Absorbed in the clouds a voice from afar said
G                                            A
With the right device you can make a pattern grow
D                       G
Or you can tune up your car

G
So we stayed on the train admiring the time
G                              A
As the lights of the city drew near
D                 G
We drank a little wine

G
They were blurry and green outer space in between
G                                    A
With a depth and a form (and a form) unclear
D                 G
Then we saw it up ahead

  C
A flickering lantern lit up on the tracks
C                    Am             G
In the rugs that had covered up the bridge
G        D
From the banks of a river to the bed
D
Of the valley upstream to the place we live

G G A D G

    C
The glass on the lantern cast back the sight
C                   Am          G
Of a drive-in movie we drove by below
   D
We saw where we'd been in the pictures within
D
Projecting all the places we would go
D     C
So we follow the scene and flowed up your steps
C                  Am         G
To a smooth wooden floor in a trance
    D
The train whistle melody wove through the trees
D                                                G
And in through the door to signal the turns of a dance

G G A D G
