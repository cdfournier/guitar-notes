G                       C
Lying wide awake in the dark
Em                             C
Trying to figure out where you are
Em
Always going nowhere
C
Fraid of going somewhere
D                               C
And somewhere's a place in your heart

Em                           C
Sometimes when I think about you
Em                        C
Why you're always running away
Em
Sitting in your car
C
Changing who you are
D                                 C
And drowning the thoughts of your life in the music

G                           C
Scared the lights will turn green
C                 Am
You'll have to be seen
Am             D
You'll be like anybody else
G                           C
Scared the lights will turn red
C                    Am
You're stuck in your head
Am        D
You can't commit to even her
D                             Em
How you gonna get through the year

    C
You can't
Em                          C
Playing on the sides of the net
Em                   C
Too many people want too many things
D                    C
And you only want to forget

G                           C
Scared the lights will turn green
C                 Am
You'll have to be seen
Am             D
You'll be like anybody else
G                           C
Scared the lights will turn red
C                    Am
You're stuck in your head
Am        D
You can't commit to even her
D
How you gonna make it through

D             C
You're always listening
C             Am
You're always listening
Am            C
You're always listening to yourself
D             C
You're always thinking
C             Am
You're always thinking
Am            C
You knew what everybody else
C                    Em
Should do with their lives
