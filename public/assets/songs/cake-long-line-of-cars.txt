          Bm
There's a long line of cars
Bm          F#            Bm
And they're trying to get through
Bm
There's no single explanation
Bm         Em           Bm
There's no central destination
Bm       F#
But this long line of cars
F#               Bm
Is trying to get through
Bm       F#
And this long line of cars
F#                Bm
Is all because of you

Bm
You don't wonder where we're going
Bm   F#                 Bm
Or remember where we've been
Bm
We've got to keep this traffic
Bm          Em              Bm
Flowing and accept a little spin
Bm      F#
So this long line of cars
F#                 Bm
Will never have an end
Bm       F#
And this long line of cars
F#                      Bm
Keeps coming around the bend

Bm F# Bm - Bm Em Bm - Bm F# Bm - Bm F# Bm

         Bm
From the streets of Sacramento
Bm     F#          Bm
To the freeways of LA
Bm
We've got to keep this fire burning
Bm  Em              Bm
And accept a little gray
Bm      F#
So this long line of cars
F#                 Bm
Is trying to break free
Bm       F#
And this long line of cars
F#                Bm
Is all because of me

     F#
This long line of cars
F#
Long line of cars
F#
Long line of cars
F#
Long line of cars
