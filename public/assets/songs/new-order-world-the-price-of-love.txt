Em                        G
   I turn sideways to the sun
G                          Em
Keep my thoughts from everyone
Em                  G
It's a jungle I'm a freak
G       C              Em   G  C
Hear me talk but never speak

Em                     G
So I'm stepping out of time
G                       Em
Because breaking in's a crime
Em                    G
And it may all be too late
G           C                Em   G  C
But I've no passion for this hate

Em                  G
That's the price of love (that's the price of love)
C                Em
Can you feel it (can you feel it)
Em                 G
If we could buy it now (that's the price of love)
C                Em
How long will it last (that's the price of love)

Em                           G
And when this building is on fire
G                           Em
These flames can't burn any higher
Em                     G
I turn sideways to the sun
G                    Em
And in a moment I am gone

Em                  G
That's the price of love (that's the price of love)
