E
Well you know just what you do to me
E
The way you move soft and slippery
E
Cut the night just like a razor
E                          D  A
Rarely talk and that's the danger

C    G   D   A
It's the one thing
C   G   D  A
You are my thing

E
You know your voice is a love song
E
It's a cat call from the past
E
There's no ice in your lovers walk
E                              D       A
You don't look twice cause you move so fast

C    G   D   A
It's the one thing
C   G   D  A
You are my thing

E
You've got a dozen men behind you
E
You've got dead flowers on the floor
E
You're too pretty in the daylight
E                         D   A
It keeps them coming back for more

C    G   D   A
It's the one thing

C    G   D   A
It's the one thing

You are my thing

C    G   D   A
It's the one thing

You are my thing
