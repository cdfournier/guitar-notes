D               A               D          G      A
What is it that makes me just a little bit queasy
D                     A                  D      G    A
There's a breeze that makes my breathing not so easy
F                                  C
I've had my lungs checked out with x-rays
F                         C        A
I've smelled the hospital hallways

D       G         D                A 
Someday I'll have   a disappearing hairline
D       G         D                A       G A
Someday I'll wear   pajamas in the daytime

D              A             D       G      A
Times when the day is like a play by Sartre
D               A                 D       G     A
When it seems a book burning's in perfect order
F                       C
I gave the doctor my description
F                             C         A
I've tried to stick to my prescriptions

D       G         D                A
Someday I'll have   a disappearing hairline
D       G         D                A
Someday I'll wear   pajamas in the daytime
G     D     A    D             G
Oh-oh-oh-oh afternoons will be measured out
Bm           G
Measured out measured with
A      D               G
Coffee spoons and T.S. Eliot

D        A            D       G       A
Maybe if I could do a play-by-playback
D                  A                 D      G       A
I could change the test results that I will get back
F                               C
I've watched the summer evening pass by
F                           C       A
I've heard the rattle in my bronchi

D       G         D                A
Someday I'll have   a disappearing hairline
D       G         D                A
Someday I'll wear   pajamas in the daytime
G     D     A    D             G
Oh-oh-oh-oh afternoons will be measured out
Bm           G
Measured out measured with
A      D               G
Coffee spoons and T.S. Eliot

A    D             G
Afternoons will be measured out
Bm           G
Measured out measured with
A      D               G
Coffee spoons and T.S. Eliot
