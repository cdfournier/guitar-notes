G                      C
She's gonna hand you a red-headed Gabriel
G                        D
Coming from the bar in a plastic tie
G                         C
He's gonna swing from the Tree of Life
G                               D
He's gonna try to sell you on a great big lie

D            C
But when you speak to her
    D
Her eyes light up
    G                  Em
The music spills right into your cup
    C                      D
The minstrels play and the waitress brings ice
D         G
There are pies on a carousel
Em
Have a slice
    C
But watch out
    D                 G
She ain't no good for you

G                        C
He's gonna spin like the tractor pull
G                       D
She'll sit back when he tells his tale
G                       C
He's gonna yell when he drinks his beer
G                         D
She'll sit back and drink ginger ale

D            C
But when you speak to her
    D
Her eyes light up
    G                  Em
The music spills right into your cup
    C                      D
The minstrels play and the waitress brings ice
D         G
There are pies on a carousel
Em
Have a slice
    C
But watch out
    D                 G
She ain't no good for you

G C G D

      C               D
She'd like to put you in her zoo
      G                            Em
Right between the canaries and the cockatoos
       C
She'll pull out your feathers
        D
For her brand new hat
    G
And when she's done that
       Em
She'll feed you to her cat

   C
So watch out
D            G        Em
She ain't no good for you
C
Watch out
D            G        Em
She ain't no good for you
C
Watch out
    D                 G
She ain't no good for you
