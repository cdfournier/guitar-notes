Em
The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
D
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky
C
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
    Em                          D
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking

     Em
He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
       D
In his youth or a dream he can't be precise
     C
He's chained forever to a world that's departed
     Em                         D
It's not enough it's not enough

    Em
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
    D
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
    C
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
    Em                          D
His step has faltered

       Em
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
    D
And silent replies that swirl invitation
C
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
  Em                 D
A grim intimation of what is to be

Em D

           Em
There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night
            D
And there's dust in my eyes that blinds my sight
    C
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
   Em                D
Of promises broken
