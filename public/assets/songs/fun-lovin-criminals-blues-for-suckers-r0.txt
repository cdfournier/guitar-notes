We got the crazy crew
You think you coming we say
Na na na we got the block locked up

E G A G

The foes that oppose me by proxy
They try to get foxy
They try to rock me
They say they got the 40 cal Glok
With the 30 round clip
And they losing their damn grip

Well I came back from hell so goddamn fit
I'll bust your lip and make you strip
You can play them games
But don't be playing in my park
I'll spill a wild bill before you get out you Town Car

Ranting and raving claiming you're armed
I'll do the hit myself and then eat a chicken parm
Mackin like bumpy the business is boomin
I'll chop your ass up like I was Jimmy Coonan
The westy I said honey don't test me
Ooooh Mr Kotter I ate 5 blotters
And things are gettin kinda whacked

If you can't live the lie let it die
And if you can't live a life full of strife
Just say oops and jump through hoops
And get to the end of the line

We got the crazy crew
You think you coming we say
Na na na we got the block locked up

We got the crazy crew
You think you coming we say
Na na na we got the block locked up

I got bear hugs for my brothers
And I got no love for the other racist mother fuckers
C'mon kids you ain't built for bids
You'll get jacked in the ass like a sucker

Mucho dinero the man with the hat said
He changed his mind once the crack in his head bled
Movin and shakin the brittle illusion
Referring concurring and workin out solutions

If you can't live the lie let it die
And if you can't live a life full of strife
Just say oops and jump through hoops
And get to the end of the line

We got the crazy crew
You think you coming we say
Na na na we got the block locked up

We got the crazy crew
You think you coming we say
Na na na we got the block locked up

We got the crazy crew
You think you coming we say
Na na na we got the block locked up

We got the crazy crew
You think you coming we say
Na na na we got the block locked up
