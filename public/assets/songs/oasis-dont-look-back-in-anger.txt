C               G           Am
Slip inside the eye of your mind
Am        E              F   G
Don't you know you might find
G                 C   Am G
A better place to play
C             G           Am
You said that you'd never been
Am          E                  F   G
But all the things that you've seen
G           C
Slowly fade away

F                               C
So I start a revolution from my bed
F                                          C
Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
F                            C
Step outside summertime's in bloom
G
Stand up beside the fireplace
E
Take that look from off your face
Am             G             F     G
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

    C  G         Am
And so Sally can wait
    E              F
She knows it's too late
F        G          C
As we're walking on by
C        G      Am
Her soul slides away
    E          F
But don't look back in anger
  G         C   Am G
I heard you say

C              G               Am
Take me to the place where you go
      E      F    G
Where nobody knows
G                C  Am G
If it's night or day
C                     G           Am
Please don't put your life in the hands
Am   E             F   G
Of a rock and roll band
G                   C
Who'll throw it all away

F                                    C
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
F                                          C

At least not today
