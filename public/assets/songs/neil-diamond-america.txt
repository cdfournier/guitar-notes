Far we've been traveling far

Without a home but not without a star

Free only want to be free

We huddle close hang on to a dream

On the boats and on the planes

They're coming to America
G
Never looking back again
G
They're coming to America

Em                    G
Home don't it seem so far away

Oh we're traveling light today
D                 F
In the eye of the storm
F                 Em
In the eye of the storm

Em                  G
Home to a new and a shiny place
G                      D
Make our bed and we'll say our grace
D                       F
Freedom's light burning warm
F                       Em
Freedom's light burning warm

F
Everywhere around the world
F
They're coming to America
F
Every time that flag's unfurled
F
They're coming to America
