G D Em C A7 C

C       G              D
It's my father's voice trailing off
Em              C                A7     C
Sailors sailing off in the morning
C       G               D
For the air-conditioned rooms
Em     C               A7     C
At the top of the stairs

C   G          D
His jaw's been broken
Em           C               A7     C
His bandages wrapped too tight
C   G               D
His fangs have been pulled
D     Em             C             A7     C
And I really want to see you tonight

C       G              D
There's bourbon on the breath
D      Em         C          A7     C
Of the singer you love so much
C  G             D
He takes all his words
D        Em                   C        A7     C
From the books that you don't read anyway

C   G          D
His jaw's been broken
D   Em       C               A7     C
His bandages wrapped too tight
C   G               D
His fangs have been pulled
      Em             C             A7     C
And I really want to see you tonight

C       G      D
Someone ties a bow
D     Em          C       A7     C
In my backyard to show me love
C  G                 D
My voice is climbing walls
Em            C    A7     C
Smoking and I want love

C  G          D
My jaw's been broken
   Em       C          A7     C
My heart is wrapped in ice
C  G               D
My fangs have been pulled
      Em             C             A7     C
And I really want to see you tonight

C      D        Em            C
And it makes no difference to me
C        Am        G        A
How they cried all over overseas
A         C          Em          G
When it's hot in the poor places tonight
Em      C     G
I'm not going outside
