G D Em C A7 C

G       D              Em
It's my father's voice sailing off
C               A7         C
Sailors sailing off in the morning
G       D               Em
For the air-conditioned rooms
C      A7         C
At the top of the stairs
G   D          Em
His jaw's been broken
C            A7          C
His bandages wrapped too tight
G   D               Em
His fangs have been pulled
      C              A7      C
And I really want to see you tonight

G       D              Em
There's bourbon on the breath
       C          A7      C
Of the singer you love so much
G  D             Em
He takes all his words
         C                    A7   C
From the books that you don't read anyway
G   D          Em
His jaw's been broken
C            A7          C
His bandages wrapped too tight
G   D               Em
His fangs have been pulled
      C              A7      C
And I really want to see you tonight

G       D      Em
Someone ties a bow
      C           A7      C
In my backyard to show me love
G  D                 Em
My voice is climbing walls
C             A7   C
Smoking and I want love
G  D          Em
My jaw's been broken
   C        A7         C
My heart is wrapped in ice
G  D               Em
My fangs have been pulled
      C              A7      C
And I really want to see you tonight

C      D        Em            C
And it makes no difference to me
C        Am        G        A
How they cried all over overseas
A         C          Em          G
When it's hot in the poor places tonight
Em      C     G
I'm not going outside
