Hey your glass is empty
A      E                  D
It's a hell of a long way home
A
Why don't you let me take you
A       C#m        D
It's no good to go alone

Bm                 A
I never would have opened up
A                 D       E
But you seemed so real to me
Bm                A
And after all the bullshit I've heard
     D                 E
It's refreshing not to see
E       D           
I don't have to pretend
    Dm                       A
She doesn't expect it from me

A             D              F#m
Don't tell me I haven't been good to you
F#m           D                 F#m
Don't tell me I have never been there for you
F#m           D              A    E
Don't tell me why nothing is good enough

A
Hey little girl would you like some candy
A    E               D
Your momma said it's okay
A
The door is open come on outside
A    C#m            D
No I can't come out today

Bm                     A
It's not the wind that cracked your shoulder
A             D      E
And threw you to the ground
Bm                         A
Who's there that makes you so afraid
A      D             E
You're shaken to the bone
E     D
And I don't understand
    Dm                        A
You deserve so much more than this

A                D                   F#m
So don't tell me why he's never been good to you
F#m           D                   F#m
Don't tell me why he's never been there for you
F#m                 D                 A    E
Don't you know that why is simply not good enough

E                 D                 F#m
Oh so just let me try and I will be good to you
F#m         D                 F#m
Just let me try and I will be there for you
F#m           D                            A    E
I'll show you why you're so much more than good enough

A D F#m - F#m D F#m - F#m D A E A

A                D                   F#m
