Well I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
           D                             A
I know not everybody has got a body like you oh
A
But I gotta think twice before I give my heart away
A          D                                          A
And I know all the games you play because I play them too

         D                       A
Oh but I need some time off from that emotion
D                                A
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
             D               A       F#m
Oh when that love comes down without devotion
        Bm
Well it takes a strong man baby
        E
But I'm showing you the door

                   A
Cause I gotta have faith

Because I got to have faith faith faith

Baby I know you're asking me to stay
                  D
Say please please please don't go away

You say I'm giving you the blues
A
Maybe huh you mean every word you say
A              D
Can't help but think of yesterday
D               A
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules

D                 A
Before this river becomes an ocean
D                                     A
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
          D             A       F#m
Oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion
       Bm
Well I need someone to hold me
         E
But I'll wait for something more

                 A
Yes I gotta have faith

Because I gotta have faith faith faith
I gotta have faith faith faith
