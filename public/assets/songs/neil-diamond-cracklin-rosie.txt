Cracklin Rosie get on board
C
We're gonna ride
C                          F
Til there ain't no more to go
F
Taking it slow
F
And Lord don't you know
Dm                           G
 We'll have me a time with a poor man's lady

C
Hitching on a twilight train
C                                      F
Ain't nothing here that I care to take along
F
Maybe a song to sing when I want
   Dm                       G
No need to say please to no man
G           C
For a happy tune

C    F       G     C
Oh I love my Rosie child
C           F      G       C
You got the way to make me happy
C       F     G     C
You and me we go in style

Dm
Cracklin Rose you're a store-bought woman
Dm
But you make me sing like a guitar humming
Dm
So hang on to me girl
Dm                     G
Our song keeps running on
Play it now play it now
Play it now my baby

Cracklin Rosie make me a smile
C                                       F
Girl if it lasts for an hour that's all right
F
We got all night to set the world right
Dm                         G                C

Our song keeps running on
Play it now play it now
