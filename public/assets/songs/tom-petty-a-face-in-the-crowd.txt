Before all of this ever went down
C          Em            C
In another place another town
C        D                  Am
You were just a face in the crowd
Am       D                  Am
You were just a face in the crowd
Am         Bm             Am
Out in the street walking around
Am            Em
A face in the crowd

C        Em               C
Out of a dream out of the sky
C       Em            C
Into my heart into my life
C            D                  Am
And you were just a face in the crowd
Am       D                  Am
You were just a face in the crowd
Am         Bm                  Am
Out in the street thinking out loud
Am            Em
A face in the crowd
