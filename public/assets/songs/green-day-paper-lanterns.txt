A             E
Now I rest my head from
E       D              A
Such an endless dreary time
A                   G
A time of hopes and happiness
G    D             A
That had you on my mind
A                       E
Those days are gone and now it seems
   D                A
As if I'll get some rest
A                     G
But now and then I'll see you again
G      D                    A
And it puts my heart to the test

   D               E                 A
So when are all my troubles going to end
    D             E
I'm understanding now that
E      A    F#m
We are only friends
F#m     G              D
To this day I'm asking why
                       A G D A
I still think about you

A              E
As the days go on I wonder
D              A
Will this ever end
A                 G
I find it hard to keep control
     D                A
When you're with your boyfriend
A                E
I do not mind if all I am is
D                A
Just a friend to you
    A             G
But all I want to know right now
G     D                  A
Is if you think about me too

   D               E                 A
So when are all my troubles going to end
    D             E
I'm understanding now that
E      A    F#m
We are only friends
F#m     G              D
To this day I'm asking why
                       A G D A
I still think about you

So when are all my troubles going to end

I'm understanding now that
E      A    F#m
We are only friends
F#m     G              D
To this day I'm asking why
                       A G D A
I still think about you
