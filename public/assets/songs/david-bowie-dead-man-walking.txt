F
He swivels his head
F         G
Tears his eyes from the screen
F                                     G
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City
F                           G
There's not even a demon in Heaven or Hell
F
Is it all just human disguise
F    G
As I walk down the aisle

G       F
And I'm gone
F                  G
Now I'm older than movies
G     F
And I know who's there
F                G
When silhouettes fall
G       A#
And I'm gone
A#                  Dm
Like I'm dancing on angels
Dm      G#                          G
And I'm gone through a crack in the past

Like a dead man walking
F      G       F      G
Like a dead man walking

F                     G
Three old men dancing under the lamplight
F
Shaking their sex and bones
F       G
And the boys that we were
F
An alien nation in therapy
F       G
Sliding naked anew
F
Like a bad tempered child
F                   G
On the rain slicked streets

G       F
And I'm gone
F                  G
Now I'm older than movies
G     F
And I know who's there
F                G
When silhouettes fall
G       A#
And I'm gone
