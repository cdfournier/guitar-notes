A               Em            A
I feel like I'm pounding on a big door
A          Em              A
No one can hear me knocking
A               Em                  A
I feel like I'm falling flat to the floor
A          Em                   D
No one can catch me from falling

D                                   A
The hourglass has no more grains of sand
A                                    Bm
My watch has stopped no more turning hands
Bm
The crew have abandoned the ship
    C
The lights are on but no one is in

A
Take it to the bridge throw it overboard
Em
See if it can swim back up to the shore
A
No one's in the house everyone is out
Em
All the lights are on and the blinds are down

No one can hear the ringing
A               Em                 A
I feel like I'm running up a steep hill
A          Em                  D
No one can stop me from running

The little hand shakes its fist
    C
The face is hanging out on a spring
