Bm                     G
I met this girl around quarter to ten

We made it once she said make me again
Bm                          G
She wrapped her love around me all night long

In the morning we were still going strong

Bm                    G

Em                           A

Bm                         G
Screamed and scratched and rolled out of the bed
Em                     A
I never really got her out of my head
Bm                         G
And now and then she makes those social calls
Em                         A
Gives me a squeeze gets me kicking the walls

Bm                    G
Now let me tell ya it still feels tight
Em                        A
And we were shaking after every bite
Bm                       G
I feel her coming in the middle of the night
Em              A E A E A E
Screaming higher
