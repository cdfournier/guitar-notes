Em         C
Like 9 til 10 love 5 point hit
C
All you had was your fist if it was in the grim
C                Am
Some say they're ignorant
Bm
They leave a trail spend hard time in jail
Bm                              Am
And bang their girl through the mail

G       C
But now millennium where did the time go
C
And while the lines show now sit dressed up before Geraldo
Am                 Bm
Now if you've seen hard times you're not alone
Em  Bm
9-7 Hoboken upon your telephone

C              Am
All my time is gone
C              Am
All my time is gone
C  Am      Bm
So familiar  I hear the music in my head

C              Am
All my time is gone
C              Am
All my time is gone
C  Am      Bm
So familiar  I hear the music in my head

      Em         C
Now I got myself in with men of respect
C
I might get off easy or get a broken neck
C             Am     Bm
But when they find me   I'll give em hell
Bm
Not fallen cause I never fail
Bm
Like Rocky til they ring of bell
Em         C
Hard times depression's curve
C
I think a lot about nouns but nothing in verbs
C             Am  Bm
I want to run away  you make me stay
Bm                                  Am
I skirt the edge of the map until I get out of range

C              Am
All my time is gone
C              Am
All my time is gone
C  Am      Bm
So familiar  I hear the music in my head

C              Am
All my time is gone
C              Am
All my time is gone
C  Am      Bm
So familiar  I hear the music in my head
