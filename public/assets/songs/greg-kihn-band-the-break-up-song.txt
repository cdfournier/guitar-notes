Am                                F
We had broken up for good just an hour before
F     G              Am
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Am                                       F
Now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancing cross the floor
F     G              Am
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Am                                         F
And then the band slowed the tempo and the music gets me down
F     G              Am
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Am                                F
It was the same old song with the melancholy sound
F     G              Am
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

F            C                     G
  They don't write em like that anymore
F                 C                     G
  They just don't write em like that anymore

Am                              F
We'd been living together for a million years
F     G              Am
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Am                                     F
But now it feels so strange out in the atmospheres
F     G              Am
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Am                                  F
And then the jukebox plays a song I used to know
F     G              Am
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Am                                    F
Now I'm staring at the bodies as they dancing so slow
F     G              Am
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

F            C                     G
  They don't write em like that anymore
F            C                     G
  They don't write em like that anymore

Am F - G Am

Am                          F
Now I wind up staring at an empty glass
F     G              Am
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Am                                   F
Cause its so easy to say that you'll forget your past
F     G              Am
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

F            C                     G
  They don't write em like that anymore
F                 C                     G
  They just don't write em like that anymore
F            C                     G
  They don't write em like that anymore
F                 C                     G
  They just don't write em like that anymore
