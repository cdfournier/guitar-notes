When I was small I believed in Santa Claus
G        D       Em     A
Though I knew it was my dad
D           A          Bm          A
And I would hang up my stocking at Christmas
G       D            Em     A
Open my presents and I'd be glad

Bm                                F#
But the last time I played Father Christmas
Bm                           F#
I stood outside a department store
D         A         Bm       A
A gang of kids came over and mugged me
G              D        Em     A
And knocked my reindeer to the floor they said

G      D         G            D
Father Christmas give us some money
G          D           A
Don't mess around with those silly toys
A     G        D         G             D
We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
G            D              G       A
We want your bread so don't make us annoyed
A            G    A                    D
Give all the toys   to the little rich boys

D             A         Bm           A
Don't give my brother a Steve Austin outfit
G             D        Em     A
Don't give my sister a cuddly toy
D               A         Bm       A
We don't want a jigsaw or Monopoly money
G       D        Em     A
We only want the real McCoy

G      D         G            D
Father Christmas give us some money

Bm                               F#
But give my daddy a job cause he needs one
Bm               F#
He's got lots of mouths to feed
D             A            Bm     A
But if you've got one I'll have a machine gun
G        D             Em          A
So I can scare all the kids on the street

G      D         G            D
Father Christmas give us some money
G         D             A
We got no time for your silly toys
A     G        D         G             D
We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
G            D              G       A
We want your bread so don't make us annoyed
