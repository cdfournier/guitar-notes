A G - D A

A               G
Dear Mr Fantasy play us a tune
D                        A
Something to make us all happy
A                   G
Do anything take us out of this gloom
D                               A
Sing a song play guitar make it snappy

A                       G
You are the one who can make us all laugh
D                               A
But doing that you break out in tears
A                               G
Please don't be sad if it was a straight mind you had
D                                    A
We wouldn't have known you all these years
