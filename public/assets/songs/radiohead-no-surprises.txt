A heart that's full up
D          G
Like a landfill
G                 Em
A job that slowly kills you

Bruises that won't heal

You look so tired unhappy

  G
A handshake of carbon monoxide

    Em            A
And no alarms and no surprises
Em            A
No alarms and no surprises
Em            A
No alarms and no surprises
D     Gm
Silent

No alarms and no surprises please

Such a pretty house

No alarms and no surprises

No alarms and no surprises
Em            A            D     Gm
No alarms and no surprises please
