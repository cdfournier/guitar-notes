Am                      F              C
Started talking and the line went dead
Am                   F            C
Never heard a single word you said
Am                      G
Babe I said I'd give my right arm
F                Em
Every day that I decide on
F                               C
Baby baby you're the world to me

G
I woke up the room was cold
Am            F
Looking tired feeling old
C               Em              F
Cursing all the changes I've to say
G
The more I cursed into the flood
G   Am             F
The less it seemed do me good
C                 Em                F
Clearer became my mind than I could say
Am                   F          C
Baby baby you're the world to me

F C - F C

Am                        F        C
My head is roaring like a waterfall
Am                    F          C
Give me everything or none at all
Am                         G
You don't have to turn the sound up
F                        Em
Babe I want you from the ground up
F                               G
Baby baby you're the world to me
Am                   F          C
Baby baby you're the world to me

Am                    G
Iridescent like a starling
F                         Em
Won't you be my little darling
F                               G
Baby baby you're the world to me

Am                   F          C
