D       A                 Bm
See the stone set in your eyes
Bm      G                   D
See the thorn twist in your side
D    A        Bm  G
I'll wait for you

D          A                 Bm
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
Bm          G                  D
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
D        A        Bm     G
And I'll wait without you

With or without you
A          Bm         G
With or without you

D           A                  Bm
Through the storm we reach the shore
Bm          G              D
You give it all but I want more

D            A
My hands are tied
Bm      G
My body bruised
G          D
She got me with
D          A
Nothing to win and
Bm              G
Nothing left to lose
