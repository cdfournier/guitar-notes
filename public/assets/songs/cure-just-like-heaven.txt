A E Bm D

A                               E
Show me show me show me how you do that trick
    Bm                D
The one that makes me scream she said
    A                 E
The one that makes me laugh she said
    Bm              D
And threw her arms around my neck
A               E
Show me how you do it
      Bm            D
And I promise you I promise that
         A            E
I'll run away with you
         Bm           D
I'll run away with you

A E Bm D

A                E
Spinning on that dizzy edge
  Bm                  D
I kissed her face and kissed her head
    A                  E
And dreamed of all the different ways 
  Bm              D
I had to make her glow
    A          E            Bm
Why are you so far away she said
Bm                 D
Why won't you ever know
D           A            E
That I'm in love with you
E           Bm           D
That I'm in love with you

F#m G
You soft and only
F#m G
You lost and lonely
F#m G
You strange as angels
D
Dancing in the deepest oceans
E                                        A
Twisting in the water you're just like a dream
A                  E
You're just like a dream

Bm D - A E Bm D

A                  E
Daylight licked me into shape
  Bm              D
I must have been asleep for days
    A              E
And moving lips to breathe her name
  Bm           D
I opened up my eyes
    A            E
And found myself alone alone
Bm            D
Alone above a raging sea
     A              E
That stole the only girl I loved
    Bm                 D
And drowned her deep inside of me

F#m G
You soft and only
F#m G
You lost and lonely
F#m G               D
You just like heaven
