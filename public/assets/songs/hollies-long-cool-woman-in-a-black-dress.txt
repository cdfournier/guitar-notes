Saturday night I was downtown
G               A  E
Working for the FBI
E
Sitting in a nest of bad men
G               A      E
Whiskey bottles piling high

E
Bootlegging boozer on the west side
        G              A     E
Full of people who are doing wrong
E
Just about to call up the DA man
       G                A         E
When I heard this woman singing a song

A
A pair of 45s made me open my eyes
                          D
My temperature started to rise
          A
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
       G             E
Just a 5'9 beautiful tall
     A
With just one look I was a bad mess
           G                      E
Cause that long cool woman had it all

E
I saw her heading to the table
       G    A                 E
Like a tall walking big black cat
E
Charlie said I hope that you're able boy
          G               A                E
Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at

E
Then suddenly we heard the sirens
    G         A          E
And everybody started to run
E
Jumping under doors and tables
       G              A          E
When I heard somebody shooting a gun

E
Well the DA was pumping my left hand
      G         A          E
And a she was a holding my right
E
Well I told her don't get scared
             G
Cause you're gonna be spared
A
I've gotta be forgiven if I wanna spend my living
A
With a long cool woman in a black dress
       G             E
Just a 5'9 beautiful tall
     A
With just one look I was a bad mess
           G                      E
Cause that long cool woman had it all
E
Had it all
E
Had it all
E         G A E 
Had it all
