A              C
I wanted to be with you alone
A                  C
And talk about the weather
    A                                  C 
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face
A               C
Won't escape my attention
A                              C
You keep your distance via the system of touch
A          C
And gentle persuasion
    A                          C
I'm lost in admiration could I need you this much
          A                      C
Oh you're wasting my time you're just just just wasting time

G                         Em
Something happens and I'm head over heels
        G                  Em
I never find out until I'm head over heels
G                         Em
Something happens and I'm head over heels
         D
Ah don't take my heart don't break my heart
D
Don't don't don't throw it away
A C              A C
   Throw it away   throw it away

A                 C
I made a fire I'm watching it burn
A               C
Thought of your future
     A                                 C
With one foot in the past now just how long will it last
A                       C
Now now now have you no ambitions
   A                              C
My mother and my brothers used to breathing clean air
A                  C
And dreaming I'm a doctor
     A                               C
It's hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand
   A      C
Oh I feel so

G                         Em
Something happens and I'm head over heels
        G                  Em
I never find out until I'm head over heels
G                         Em
Something happens and I'm head over heels
         D
Ah don't take my heart don't break my heart
D
Don't don't don't throw it away
