Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot
D
Watching the sun set
G
I'll never forget
G                         C            G
Watching all the reds and oranges slip away
D                               G
Letting go of yet another dirty day

C
Breathing in the fumes from so many idling cars
D
Right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars
C                   G
Watching the sun go down

Watching the sun go down

Watching the sun the sun
D                   G
Watching the sun go down

Watching you leave me

Not quite believing
