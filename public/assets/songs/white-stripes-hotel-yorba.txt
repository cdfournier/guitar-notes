I was watching
G        C
With one eye on the other side
C     D
I had fifteen people telling me to move
D     G
I got moving on my mind
G
I found shelter
G       C
In some thoughts turning wheels around
C      D
I said thirty-nine times that I love you
D      G
To the beauty I had found

G
Well it's one two three four
G                        C
Take the elevator at the Hotel Yorba
C                           D
I'll be glad to see you later
D                            G F G
All they got inside is vacancy

G
I've been thinking
G           C
Of a little place down by the lake
C          D
They got a dirty old road leading up to the house
D        G
I wonder how long it will take
G
Till we're alone
G              C
Sitting on the front porch of that home
D
Stomping our feet on the wooden boards
G
Never gotta worry bout locking the door

G
Well it's one two three four
G                        C
Take the elevator at the Hotel Yorba
C                           D
I'll be glad to see you later
D                            G F G

G
It might sound silly
G               C
For me to think childish thoughts like these
C   D
But I'm so tired of acting tough
D       G
And I'm gonna do what I please
G
Let's get married
G            C
In a big cathedral by a priest
G        D
Cause if I'm the man that you love the most
D         G
You could say I do at least

G
Well it's one two three four
G                        C
Take the elevator at the Hotel Yorba
C                           D
I'll be glad to see you later
D                            G
All they got inside is vacancy

G
And it's four five six seven
G                      C
Grab your umbrella and grab hold of me
C                           D
Cause I'm your favorite fella
D                            G C G D G
All they got inside is vacancy
