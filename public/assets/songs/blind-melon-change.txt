A G - D G A

A                             G
I don't feel the sun's coming out today
G            D
It's staying in
D          G            A
It's gonna find another way
A                     G
As I sit here in this misery
G                  D       G
I don't think I'll ever no no
G                A
See the sun from here

D     G            A
  And oh as I fade away
D             G              A
  They'll all look at me and say and they'll say
D               G          A
Hey look at him I'll never live that way
A          G
And that's okay
                             A
They're just afraid to change

A G - D G A

A                              G
When you feel life ain't worth living
G
You've got to stand up
G   D
And take a look around you 
D   G                  A
And look up way to the sky
A                                  G
And when your deepest thoughts are broken
G       D
Keep on dreaming boy
D                   G                     A
Cause when you stop dreaming it's time to die

D               G             A
  And as we all play parts of tomorrow
D               G                         A
Some ways we'll work and other ways we'll play
D                   G             A
But I know we can't all stay here forever
A            D        G                    A
So I'm gonna write my words on the face of today
And then they'll paint it

A               G
Dear Mr Fantasy play us a tune
D            G           A
Something to make us all happy
A                   G
Do anything take us out of this gloom
G      D         G
Sing a song play guitar
G       A
Make it snappy

A                       G
You are the one who can make us all laugh
D              G                A
But doing that you break out in tears
A                               G
Please don't be sad if it was a straight mind you had
D                G                   A
We wouldn't have known you all these years

D      G         A
And oh as I fade away
D             G              A
  They'll all look at me and say and they'll say
D           G                A
Hey look at him and where he is these days
A            D                G
When life is hard you have to change
A            D                G
When life is hard you have to change
