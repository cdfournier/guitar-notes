Am Dm Am - Dm Am

Am            Dm
It seems like every single day
Dm
I hear all of my friends say
Dm          G        Am
You're just too damn crazy

Am                Dm
And it seems like every dawn that breaks
Dm
I reflect on what it takes
Dm               G         Am
Sometimes I just can't see past this

   Dm
We got our love
Dm                       G       Am
But I don't know what to do with it
   Dm
We got our love
Dm                       Am
But I don't know what to do with it

Am         Dm
Seems like every single time
Dm
When I hear that Patsy Cline
Dm              G       Am
I think of when we were younger

Am        Dm
Now I see people and their lies
Dm
Through frosted glass and swollen eyes
Dm             G            Am
Can't you just get over yourself and call

   Dm
We got our love
Dm                       G       Am
But I don't know what to do with it
           Dm
Oh yeah we got our love
Dm                       Am
But I don't know what to do with it
           Dm
Because we got our love
Dm                       G       Am
But I don't know what to do with it
   Dm
We got our love
Dm                       Am
But I don't know what to do with it
