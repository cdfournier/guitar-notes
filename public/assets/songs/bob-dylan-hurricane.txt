Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out My God they killed them all


Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world


Three bodies lying there does Patty see
And another man named Bello moving around mysteriously
I didn't do it he says and he throws up his hands
I was only robbing the register I hope you understand


I saw them leaving he says and he stops
One of us had better call up the cops
And so Patty calls the cops and they arrive on the scene
With their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night


Meanwhile far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down


When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
Unless you want to draw the heat


Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around
He said I saw two men running out they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates


And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said Wait a minute boys this one's not dead
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him he could identify the guilty men


Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
They take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
Say Why did you bring him in here for He ain't the guy


Here's the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world


Four months later the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America fighting for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are putting the screws to him
Looking for somebody to blame


Remember that murder that happened in a bar
Remember you said you saw the getaway car
You think you'd like to play ball with the law
Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw
Running that night
Don't forget that you are white


Arthur Dexter Bradley said I'm really not sure
The cops said A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we're talking to your friend Bello
Now you don't want to have to go back to jail be a nice fellow


You'll be doing society a favor
That son of a bitch is brave and getting braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder
On him
He ain't no Gentleman Jim


Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
It's my work he'd say and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way


Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse


All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum


And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigga
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed


Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder one guess who testified
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers they all went along for the ride


How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed
To live in a land where justice is a game


Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink Martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell


Yes that's the story of the Hurricane
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done
Put in a prison cell but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world
