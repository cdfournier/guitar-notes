Am                           F
Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Am                             F
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
Am                          F
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Am                    F
Cries out My God they killed them all

C                           F
Here comes the story of the Hurricane
C                       F
The man the authorities came to blame
Dm                          C
For something that he never done
Dm                       C   Em
Put in a prison cell but one time
Em         Am       F               C     G
He could-a been the champion of the world

Am F - Am F

Am                       F
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
Am                                        F
And another man named Bello moving around mysteriously
Am                            F
I didn't do it he says and he throws up his hands
Am                                F
I was only robbing the register I hope you understand

C                     F
I saw them leaving he says and he stops
C                    F
One of us had better call up the cops
Dm                     C
And so Patty calls the cops
Dm                     C
And they arrive on the scene
Em                    Am
With their red lights flashing
F                     C     G
In the hot New Jersey night

Am F - Am F

Am                    F
Meanwhile far away in another part of town
Am                                       F
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around
Am                           F
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Am                     F
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

C                                 F
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
C                                 F
Just like the time before and the time before that
   Dm                                  C
In Paterson that's just the way things go
C         Dm                          C
If you're black you might as well not show
Em        Am                F                C    G
Up on the street unless you want to draw the heat

Am                                      F
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Am                                      F
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around
Am                                                 F
He said I saw two men running out they looked like middleweights
Am                                F
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates

C                             F
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
C                           F
Cop said wait a minute boys this one's not dead
Dm                           C
So they took him to the infirmary
Dm                               C
And though this man could hardly see
Em               Am    F                   C   G
They told him he could identify the guilty men

Am F - Am F

Am                           F
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
Am                                     F
They take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs
Am                                   F
The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
Am                                    F
Say why did you bring him in here for he ain't the guy

C                        F
Here is the story of the Hurricane
C                       F
The man the authorities came to blame
Dm                          C
For something that he never done
Dm                       C   Em              Am
Put in a prison cell but one time he could-a been
    F               C     G
The champion of the world

Am F - Am F

Am                    F
Four months later the ghettos are in flame
Am                       F
Rubin's in South America fighting for his name
Am                                         F
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
Am                           F
And the cops are putting the screws to him
Am                      F
Looking for somebody to blame

C                         F
Remember that murder that happened in a bar
C                             F
Remember you said you saw the getaway car
Dm                                         C
You think you'd like to play ball with the law
Dm                                          C
Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw
Em           Am          F                   C     G
Running that night don't forget that you are white

Am F - Am F

Am                         F
Arthur Dexter Bradley said I'm really not sure
Am                                F
The cops said a poor boy like you could use a break
Am                                     F
We got you for the motel job and we're talking to your friend Bello
Am                                            F
Now you don't want to have to go back to jail be a nice fellow

C               F
You'll be doing society a favor
C                      F
That son of a bitch is brave and getting braver
Dm                        C
We want to put his ass in stir
Dm                         C  Em
We want to pin this triple murder
   Am     F                  C   G
On him he ain't no Gentleman Jim

Am F - Am F

Am                              F
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
Am                                     F
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
Am                          F
It's my work he'd say and I do it for pay
Am                             F
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way

C          F
Up to some paradise
C                                    F
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
Dm                       C
And ride a horse along a trail
Dm                            C   Em
But then they took him to the jailhouse
           Am            F          C    G
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse

Am F - Am F

Am                        F
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
Am                                  F
The trial was a pig-circus he never had a chance
Am                               F
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
Am                                      F
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum

C                                    F
And to the black folks he was just a crazy figure
C                      F
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
Dm                                    C
And though they could not produce the gun
Dm                     C   Em          Am
The DA said he was the one who did the deed
Am      F              C     G
And the all-white jury agreed

Am F - Am F

Am               F
Rubin Carter was falsely tried
Am                       F
The crime was murder one guess who testified
Am                         F
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
Am                               F
And the newspapers they all went along for the ride

C                   F
How can the life of such a man
C                 F
Be in the palm of some fool's hand
Dm                   C
To see him obviously framed
Dm                             C
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed
Em           Am         F            C   G
To live in a land where justice is a game

Am F - Am F

Am                             F
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Am                             F
Are free to drink Martinis and watch the sun rise
Am                                F
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
Am                   F
An innocent man in a living hell

C                           F
Yes that's the story of the Hurricane
C                             F
But it won't be over til they clear his name
Dm                              C
And give him back the time he's done
Dm                       C   Em
Put in a prison cell but one time
Em         Am       F               C     G
He could-a been the champion of the world
