G     D
Ooo I bet you're wondering how I knew
D          A                G
About your plans to make me blue
G               D            
With some other guy that you knew before
D                     A
Between the two of us guys
A                    G
You know I loved you more
G             Bm              G
It took me by surprise I must say
G      D         G
When I found out yesterday

G     D                    G
Ooo I heard it through the grapevine
G        D                   G
Not much longer would you be mine
G     D                    G
Ooo I heard it through the grapevine
G       D                     G
And I'm just about to lose my mind
G           D
Honey honey yeah

D
You know that a man ain't supposed to cry
D         A                  G
But these tears I can't hold inside
G      D
Losing you would end my life you see
D         A                 G
Cause you mean that much to me
G              Bm          G
You could have told me yourself
G        D             G
That you found someone else

G         D                    G
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
G        D                   G
Not much longer would you be mine
G     D                    G
Ooo I heard it through the grapevine
G       D                     G
And I'm just about to lose my mind
G           D
Honey honey yeah

D
People say you believe half from what you see
D     A                 G
No no not from what you hear
G       D
I can't help being confused
D       A                  G
If it's true won't tell me here
G      Bm             G
Do you plan to let me go
G             D                 G
For the other guy that you knew before

G     D                    G
Ooo I heard it through the grapevine
G        D                   G
Not much longer would you be mine
G     D                    G
Ooo I heard it through the grapevine
G       D                     G
And I'm just about to lose my mind
G           D
Honey honey yeah

G     D                    G
Ooo I heard it through the grapevine
G        D                   G
Not much longer would you be mine
G     D                    G
Ooo I heard it through the grapevine
G       D                     G
And I'm just about to lose my mind

G     D                    G
Ooo I heard it through the grapevine
G        D                   G
Not much longer would you be mine
G     D                    G
Ahh I heard it through the grapevine
G       D                     G
And I'm just about to lose my mind
G           D
Honey honey yeah
