If you ever get close to a human and human behavior
Am
Be ready be ready to get confused
Am
And be in my head after
Am
There's definitely definitely definitely no logic to human behavior
Am
But yet so yet so irresistible
Am                  Bbm
And me and my fear can
Bbm
And there is no map
Bbm     Am
Uncertain

Am
They're terribly terribly terribly moody of human behavior
Am
Then all of a sudden turn happy
Am
And they and my here after
Am
But oh to get involved in the exchange
Am
Of human emotions
Am
Is ever so ever so satisfying
Am                   Bbm
And they and my here on
Bbm
And there is no map
Bbm       Am
And chair too

Am
Human behavior
Human behavior
Human behavior
Human behavior

Bbm
And there is no map
Bbm
And a compass wouldn't help at all yeah
Bbm     Am
Uncertain

Am
Human behavior
Human behavior
Human behavior
Human behavior

Am
There's definitely definitely definitely no logic
To human
To human
To human
To human
