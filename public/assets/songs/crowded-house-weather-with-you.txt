A Em A - A Em A

A                 Em                  A
Walking round the room singing Stormy Weather
A        Em                A
At fifty-seven Mt Pleasant Street
A            Em                         A
Now it's the same room but everything's different
A                 Em                A
You can fight the sleep but not the dream

Dm           C       Dm       C       Dm
Things ain't cooking    in my kitchen
Dm         C            F
Strange affliction wash over me
Dm     C      Dm               C       Dm
Julius Caesar    and the Roman Empire
Dm       C           F      G
Couldn't conquer the blue sky

A Em A

A              Em                 A
Well there's a small boat made of china
A          Em                    A
It's going nowhere on the mantel piece
A         Em                     A
Well do I lie like a lounge room lizard
A       Em                 A
Or do I sing like a bird released
