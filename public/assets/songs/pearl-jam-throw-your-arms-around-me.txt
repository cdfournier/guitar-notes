A      D                     G
I will come to you in the daytime
G      D                   A
I will raise you from your sleep
A      D                     G
I will kiss you in four places
G       D                 A
As I go running down your street

A      D                             G
I will squeeze the life right out of you
G      D                           A
I will make you laugh and make you cry
A      D                G
And we may never forget it
G    D
As I make you call my name
D      G                           A
As you shout it to the blue summer sky

A          D              G
And we may never meet again
G  D                        A
So shed your skin let's get started
A            D   G           A
And you will throw your arms around me
A            D   G           A
And you will throw your arms around me

I will kiss you in 195 places
G       D                       A
As I go swimming around in your head

A      D                             G
I will squeeze the life right out of you
G      D                            A
