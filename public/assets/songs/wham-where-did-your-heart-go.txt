Am E Am - Am E Am - F G

Am
I spend my nights down on the wharf
E        Am
In unlit alleyways
Am
By the church downtown
E           Am
Where Sally prays

F         G
Come down sometime
G                   Am
We'll share a rusty can of corn
F                 G
And listen to the radio
E                        G
I love you I love you it says

Am             Dm
Where did your heart go
G              Am
Did you put it on a train
F                G
Did you leave it in the rain
E          G
Or down in Mexico

Am             Dm
Where did your heart go
G              Am
Did you put it on a train
F                G
Did you leave it in the rain
E          G
Or down in Mexico

Am
You cry but I don't know how
E                 Am
I've heard it all before
Am
There it goes it again
E                   Am
The slamming of the door

F                   G
Sometimes the river calls me
Am
And at night it calls my name
F                      G
Says put your troubles down beside me
E                           G
Things have always been the same

Am E Am - Am E Am - F G

Am
And rock and roll won't teach me
E                        Am
What the river said that night
Am
I jumped into this beauty
G                  E
And drifted out of sight

Am             Dm
Where did your heart go
G              Am
Did you put it on a train
F                G
Did you leave it in the rain
E          G
Or down in Mexico

Am             Dm
Where did your heart go
G              Am
Did you put it on a train
F                G
Did you leave it in the rain
E          G
Or down in Mexico
