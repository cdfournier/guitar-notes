Em G Am D

Em
She had hair like Jeannie Shrimpton
Em      G
Back in 1965
G       Am
She had legs that never ended
Am    D           Em
I was halfway paralyzed
Em
She was tall and cool and pretty
Em      G
And she dressed as black as coal
G      Am
If she asked me to I'd murder
Am      D              Em
I would gladly lose my soul

Now I lie in bed and think of her
    G            Em
Sometimes I even weep
Em     Am
Then I dream of her
  D                Em
Behind the wall of sleep

Em
Well she held a bass guitar
Em          G
And she was playing in a band
G       Am
And she stood just like Bill Wyman
Am    D              Em
Now I am her biggest fan
Em
Now I know I'm one of many who
Em    G
Would like to be your friend
G        Am
And I've got to find a way
Am         D                 Em
To let you know I'm not like them

Em    G              Em
Now I lie in bed and think of her
    G            Em
Sometimes I even weep
Em     Am
Then I dream of her
  D                Em
Behind the wall of sleep

Got your number from a friend of mine

Who lives in your hometown
G          Am
Called you up to have a drink
Am            D                Em
Your roommate said you weren't around
