I really think I better get a hold of myself
Don't want to let the night get ahead of myself
Whispering her love through a smoke ring smile
She doesn't know what happens when she's around

I think I'm in love
G      D                         E
But it makes me kinda nervous to say so
  F

Probably lay my head on a wooden floor
Tell her I was tired from working the store
Counting all the cash from an old shoebox
Saving up to buy her something she wants

What if it's wrong
F#m          Am               E
What if it's wrong to pray in vain
E            G#m
What does it mean
G                     F#m     Am
To fake your death to wake up tainted

Take a little picture in a photo booth
Keep it in a locket and I think of you
Both of our pictures face to face
Take off your necklace and throw it away
