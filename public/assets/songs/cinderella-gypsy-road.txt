G                                          A
I used to be now I'm not what you see Lord I try
A          G
And now it seems all those dreams have come true
G                      A
But they're passing me by

     C                       G
Some fast talking mama for a dollar
C                 D
Put a smile on my face
    C
I'm driving all night
  G                      F    E
I end up in the same old place

   A                D
My gypsy road can't take me home
  G                       D
I drive all night just to see the light
   A                D
My gypsy road can't take me home
  G                        D        A    G
I keep on pushing cause it feels alright

G                                          A
And who's to care if I grow my hair to the sky
A           G
I'll take a wish and a prayer cross my fingers
G                  A
Cause I always get by

     C                       G
Some fast talking jerk for a dollar
C                 D
Wiped the smile off my face
    C
I'm driving all night
  G                         F   E
Just to keep the rat in the race

   A                D
My gypsy road can't take me home
  G                       D
I drive all night just to see the light
   A                D
My gypsy road can't take me home
  G                        D        A    G
I keep on pushing cause it feels alright

Bm                  G
Sometimes I feel so old
       D
Got my lights burning bright
        A
But I'm looking pretty sold
Bm                  G
Sometimes I feel so cold
A
So cold let's go
