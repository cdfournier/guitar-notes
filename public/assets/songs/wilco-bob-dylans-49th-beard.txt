G
You'll be happier when I'm gone
C
I'm much to busy to worry
G
I'll be sad and you'll feel bad
C                      D
But I know you wont be sorry
G
As I turn to go
C
Please don't wave goodbye
G
I won't cry on roads that are paved
C            D
With men who behave
C                            D
Like they know where they're going

G
And I'll stop along the way
C
It's then I'll think of you
G
And I'll wonder if you knew
C          D
When I get blue
C              D
And things got weird
C             D
And I started growing
C   D       G
Bob Dylan's beard
