D
Treated you like a rusty blade
D
A throwaway from an open grave
F                    Em
Cut you loose from a chain gang
Em  D
And let you go

D
And on the day you said it's true
D
Some love holds some gets used
F                   Em
Tried to tell you I never knew
Em       D
It could be so sweet

B              Am
Who could ever be so cruel
G                       F           C  A
Blame the devil for the things you do
D
It's such a selfish way to lose
D   F                  Em
The way you lose these wasted blues
Em    D
These wasted blues

D                 C
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Em             D
Nobody's fault but my own
D                 C
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Em             D
Nobody's fault but my own
D                 C
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Em             D
Nobody's fault but my own
D                 C
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Em             D
Nobody's fault but my own

D
When the moon is a counterfeit
D
Better find the one that fits
F               Em
Better find the one that lights
Em  D
The way for you

D
When the road is full of nails
D
Garbage pails and darkened jails
F                             Em
And their tongues are full of heartless tales
Em   D
That drain on you

B              Am
Who would ever notice you
G               F         C  A
You fade into a shaded room
D
It's such a selfish way to lose
D   F                  Em
The way you lose these wasted blues
Em    D
These wasted blues

D                 C
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Em             D
Nobody's fault but my own
D                 C
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Em             D
Nobody's fault but my own
D                 C
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Em             D
Nobody's fault but my own
D                 C
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Em             D
Nobody's fault but my own

D                 C
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Em             D
Nobody's fault but my own
D                 C
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Em             D
Nobody's fault but my own
