A G

A
Me in the world
A      G              A
Losing tears shedding fears
A
Strain for the sun
A        G            A
Make you run make you come

D         G    D         G
You don't know you don't know

A
I'm in my home
A       G          A
All the time on my own
A
Low finger fine
A           G           A
Take what's mine from behind

D         G    D         G
You don't know you don't know
D        G     D         G
It's not there you don't care

A
You're still inside of me
  G                A
Beneath the cotton core
A
My pictures smile at me
    G                     A
And soon they'll rise and soar

A
Fill up my space
A     G              A
Turn around fade and trace
A
Be absolute
A        G           A
Blue and white fatal fruit

A
She nylon smile
A       G            A
Full of lies shining eyes
A
Cover my grin
A      G            A
Take a chance maybe win

D        G     D        G
It's not there it's not fair
D         G    D         G
You don't know you don't care
