G
Into the distance a ribbon of black
Em                                       D
Stretched to the point of no turning back
  G
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Em                              D
Standing alone as my senses reel
  G
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
Em                                      D
How can I escape this irresistible grasp

C                           Am
Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
F                               C          D      G
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earthbound misfit I

G G Em A D

G
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Em                                                   D
Unheeded warnings I thought I'd thought of everything
G
No navigator to find my way home
Em                               D
Unladen empty and turned to stone

  C                      Am
A soul in tension that's learning to fly
F                      C
Condition grounded but determined to try
C                           Am
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
F                               C          D      G
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earthbound misfit I

G
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
Em                                           D
My grubby halo a vapor trail in the empty air
G
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Em                                  D
Out of the corner of my watering eye
  G
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Em                                                      D
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

        C                  Am
There's no sensation to compare with this
F                     C
Suspended animation a state of bliss
C                           Am
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
F                               C          D      G
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earthbound misfit I
