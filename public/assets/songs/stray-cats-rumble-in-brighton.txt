Em
Well there's the rockabilly cats with their pomps real high
Em
Wearing black drape coats all real gone guys
Am
The cool skinheads with the rolled up jeans
Em
Looking real tough and mighty mean

Bm                           Am
There's a rumble in Brighton tonight
Bm                     Am
Ringside seats for the neighborhood fight
Bm                                Am
There ain't a damn thing that the cops can do
Am        Em
There's a rumble in Brighton tonight

Em
They sew fish hooks under their collars
Em
They got razors in their shoes
Am
Go cat go is their battle cry
Em
World War III is starting to brew

Em
Now the skinheads all use black jacks
Em
And they're looking mighty mean
Am
They got chains wrapped around their fingers
Am        Em
And their heads are all shaven clean

Bm                           Am
There's a rumble in Brighton tonight
Bm                     Am
Ringside seats for the neighborhood fight
Bm                                Am
There ain't a damn thing that the cops can do
Am        Em
There's a rumble in Brighton tonight

Em
Well there ain't a man left standing
Em
So let's all go get a beer
Am
No team is the winner
Am       Em
So we'll see you all next year

Bm                           Am
There's a rumble in Brighton tonight
Bm                     Am
Ringside seats for the neighborhood fight
Bm                                Am
There ain't a damn thing that the cops can do
Am        Em
There's a rumble in Brighton tonight

Em
Rumble in Brighton tonight
Em
Rumble on the beach tonight
Am
Rumble in Brighton tonight
Em
Rumble on the beach tonight

Em            Bm                  Am
There ain't a damn thing that the cops can do
   Bm                 Am
So line back up for a side line view
Bm                     Am
Ringside seats for the neighborhood fight
Am        Em
There's a rumble in Brighton tonight
