A  D
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
D                            A
When you're perfect in every way
A
I can't wait to look in the mirror
A                               D
Cause I get better looking each day

   D
To know me is to love me
D                     G
I must be a hell of a man
G                       D
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
D       A                     D
But I'm doing the best that I can

D
I used to have a girlfriend
D                                A
But I guess she just couldn't compete
A
With all of these love-starved women
A                        D
Who keep clamoring at my feet

D
Well I probably could find me another
D                                 G
But I guess they're all in awe of me
G                     D
Who cares I never get lonesome
D       A                     D  A
Cause I treasure my own company

A  D
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
D                            A
When you're perfect in every way
A
I can't wait to look in the mirror
A                         D
I get better looking each day

   D
To know me is to love me
D                     G
I must be a hell of a man
G                       D
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
D       A                     D
We're doing the best that we can

  D
I guess you could say I'm a loner
D                         A
A cowboy outlaw tough and proud
A
Well I could have lotsa friends if I wanted
A                                      D
But then I wouldn't stand out from the crowd

D
Some folks say that I'm egotistical
D                                G
Hell I don't even know what that means
G                           D
I guess it has something to do with the way
D      A                           D      A
That I fill out my skin-tight blue jeans

A  D
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
D                            A
When you're perfect in every way
A
I can't wait to look in the mirror
A                         D
I get better looking each day

D
To know me is to love me
D                     G
I must be a hell of a man
G                       D
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
D     A                      D
We're doing the best that we can
D     A                      D
We're doing the best that we can
