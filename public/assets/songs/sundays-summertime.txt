Some people wind up
E        A             E
With the one that they adore
E    A              E
In a heart-shaped hotel room
E    A               E
It's what a heart is for
E   A                E
The bubble floats so madly
E       A         E
Will it stay sky-high
A        E              A        E     A

Oh sometimes

We'll be hand-in-hand down in the park

With a squeeze and a sigh

And that twinkle in your eye
A           E
And all the sunshine banishes the dark

Some people wind up
E        A             E
With the one that they abhor
E    A            E
In a distant hell-hole room
E    A           E
This third World War

Where a colorless despair

Meant angry young men with immaculate hair

Oh sometimes

There's no time for looking down

And how do you coin the phrase though
A                       E
That will set your soul apart
A       E       A      E     A
Just to touch a lonely heart

A
And it's you and me in the summertime
A        E
We'll be hand-in-hand down in the park
E      A
With a squeeze and a sigh
A
And the twinkle in your eye
A           E
And all the sunshine banishes the dark

A
And it's you I need in the summertime
A            E
As I turn my white skin red
E   A
Two peas from the same pod yes we are
A              E        A
Or have I read too much fiction
