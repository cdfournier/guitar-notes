E                       C            E
There's a light when my baby's in my arms
E                        C                 E
There's a light when the window shades are drawn
E               C             E
Hesitate when I feel I may do harm to her
E                       C              E
Watch it all cause this feeling we can share
      C                     D    A   E
And I know she's reached my heart in thin air

E            C                E
Byzantine is reflected in our pond
E                       C             E
There's a cloud but the water remains calm
E                    C                  E
Reaching in the suns fingers clutch the dawn to pass
E               C                 E
Even now it's a precious thing to bear
      C                     D    A   E
And I know she's reached my heart in thin air
      C                     D    A   E
Yes I know she's reached my heart in thin air

F              C       G
It's not in my plan to presume
         D                 A
Love can keep on moving in both directions
F         C         G
How to be happy and true
       D                  A
Is the quest we're taking on together
       E
Taking on on on on
E
Taking on on on on on on

E                       C            E
There's a light when my baby's in my arms
      C                     D    A   E
And I know she's reached my heart in thin air
      C                     D    A   E
And I know she's reached my heart in thin air
      C                     D    A   E
Yes I know she's reached my heart in thin air
      C                     D    A
Yes I know she's reached my heart
