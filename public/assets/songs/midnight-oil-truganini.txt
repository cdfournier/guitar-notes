Em
There's a road train going nowhere
Roads are cut lines are down
We'll be staying at the Roma Bar
Til that monsoon passes on

Em                                   G A Em
The backbone of this country's broken
Em                                      G A Em
The land is cracked and the land is sore
Em                                        G A Em
Farmers are hanging on by their fingertips
Em                                 D
We cursed and stumbled across that shore

G      Dm
I hear much support for the monarchy
G          Dm              F
I hear the Union Jack's to remain
G     Dm
I see Namatjira in custody
Am    Em             C
I see Truganini's in chains
Em
And the world it won't stand still

Em                                       G A Em
Blue collar work it don't get you nowhere
Em                                 G A Em
You just go round and round in debt
Em                                       G A Em
Somebody's got you on that treadmill mate
Em                           D
And I hope you're not beaten yet

G      Dm
I hear much support for the monarchy
G          Dm              F
I hear the Union Jack's to remain
G     Dm
I see Namatjira in custody
Am    Em             C
I see Truganini's in chains

Em G A Em - Em G A Em

G      Dm
I hear much support for the monarchy
G         Dm            F
I see the Union Jack in flames let it burn
G     Dm
I see Namatjira with dignity
Am    Em             C
I see Truganini's in chains

Em
And the world it won't stand still
And the world it won't stand still
And the world it won't stand still
