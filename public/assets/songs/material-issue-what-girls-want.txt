I met her somewhere in the corner of my eye
E             A           D          E
I keep her somehow in the back of my mind
E              A              D               E
It wasn't long ago I tried to show her my affection
E                    A                 D     E
She turned looked at me and ran in the other direction

E                  A            D       E
I want love I want drugs I want sex and affection
E                       A            D          E
I want everyone in this room here to look in my direction
E                 A         D         E
I want a man with lips just like Mick Jagger
E             A        D               E

E             A               D      E
So I took her back home to my studio apartment
E                  A                        D     E
And that's where I told her exactly what my heart meant
E            A                  D          E
I started to think she threw it back in my face
E              A                        D           E
I poured her a drink she said let's get out of this place

E                  A            D       E
I want love I want drugs I want sex and affection

She came around and moved in three weeks later
E                 A          D            E
We got a one room shack just north of the equator
E            A            D     E
With a giant stereo and a manic TV
E               A                    D         E
Every once in a while she says these things to me
