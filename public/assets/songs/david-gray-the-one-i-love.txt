G
Gonna close my eyes
G        D
Girl and watch you go
D       C                 Am
Running through this life darling
Am     G
Like a field of snow
G
As the tracer glides
G      D
In its graceful arc
D      C                 Am
Send a little prayer out to ya
Am        G
Cross the falling dark

G        C
Tell the repo man
C       Am
And the stars above
Am              G
That you're the one I love yeah

G
Perfect summers night
G     D
Not a wind that breathes
D        C                  Am
Just the bullets whispering gentle
Am          G
Amongst the new green leaves
G
There's things I might have said
G    D
Only wish I could
D       C            Am
Now I'm leaking life faster
Am       G
Then I'm leaking blood


G        C
Tell the repo man
C       Am
And the stars above
Am              G
That you're the one I love
G          D
You're the one I love
D   Am        C
The one I love

C     G
Don't see Elysium
G            D
Don't see no fiery hell
D        C                Am
Just the lights up bright baby
Am         G
In the bay hotel
G
Next wave coming in
G       D
Like an ocean roar
D         C            Am
Won't you take my hand darling
Am      G
On that old dance floor

G      C
We can twist and shout
C      Am
Do the turtle dove
Am             G
And you're the one I love
G          D
You're the one I love
D   Am        C
The one I love
