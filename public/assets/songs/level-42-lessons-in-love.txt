G       D           Em
I'm not proud I was wrong
        C                G
And the truth is hard to take
       D           Em
I felt sure we had enough
        C         G
But our love went overboard
         D            Em
Lifeboat lies lost at sea
          C                    G
I've been trying to reach your shore
         D                   Em D
Waves of doubt keep drowning me

        C                   Am      D
All the dreams that we were building
         Em
We never fulfilled them
         C                Am    D
Could be better should be better
               Em  D G
For lessons in love

G            D         Em
For restless eyes egos burn
        C               G
And the mold is hard to break
          D            Em
Now we've waded in too deep
    C       G
And love is overboard
      D            Em
Heavy hearts token words
        C            G
All the hopes I ever had
     D                      Em   D
Fade like footprints in the sand

        C                  Am      D
All the homes that we were building
         Em
We never lived in
         C                Am    D
Could be better should be better
           Em  D
Lessons in love

      C             Am        D
If we lose the time before us
           Em
The future will ignore us
          C               Am         D
We should use it we could use it yeah

           G
Lessons in love
             F               C   D
When there's nowhere left to turn

           G
Lessons in love
