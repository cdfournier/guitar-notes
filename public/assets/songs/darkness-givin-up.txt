My mama wants to know
A
Where I'm spending all my dough
A                             E
Honey all she does is nag nag nag
A
But I won't apologize
A
I'd inject into my eyes
A                                     E
If there was nowhere else to stick my skag
A
All I want is brown
A
And I'm going into town
A                          E
Shooting up as soon as I'm back
A
My friends have got some good shit
A
All I want is some of it
A                      E    F# A

A
Getting off my face
S
There's a dragon I must chase
A                               E
Honey I'm the scourge of all mankind
A
And everyone but me
A
Is destined just to be
A                         E    F# A
Slaves to the remorseless grind

A     E                        D
But I found myself an easy way out
E                          D
Sticking that fucking shit into my arms
D
Into my arms
