Bm        F#m                Bm
When they kick at your front door
F#m           Bm
How you gonna come
Bm        G             Bm
With your hands on your head
Bm        G               Bm
Or on the trigger of your gun

Bm       F#m       Bm
When the law break in
F#m           Bm
How you gonna go
G                Bm
Shot down on the pavement
   G                Bm
Or waiting in death row

Bm      F#m
You can crush us
F#m     Bm
You can bruise us
Bm         F#m            Bm
But you'll have to answer to
G      Bm      G      Bm
Oh the guns of Brixton

Bm  F#m         Bm
The money feels good
Bm       F#m              Bm
And your life you like it well
Bm  G                     Bm
But surely your time will come
Bm    G            Bm
As in heaven as in hell

Bm  F#m               Bm
You see he feels like Ivan
Bm   F#m               Bm
Born under the Brixton sun
Bm  G                 Bm
His game is called surviving
Bm     G                      Bm
At the end of The Harder They Come

Bm  F#m              Bm
You know it means no mercy
Bm   F#m               Bm
They caught him with a gun
Bm G                  Bm
No need for the Black Maria
Bm G                   Bm
Goodbye to the Brixton sun

Bm      F#m
You can crush us
F#m     Bm
You can bruise us

You can crush us

You can bruise us
Bm  F#m      Bm
You can even shoot us
Bm  G      Bm      G      Bm
But oh the guns of Brixton

G                Bm
Shot down on the pavement
   G                Bm
Or waiting in death row
Bm  G                 Bm
His game is called surviving

As in heaven as in hell
