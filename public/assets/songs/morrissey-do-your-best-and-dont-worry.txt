Am          F             Am
Compare the best of their days
Am       F             Am  Dm
With the worst of your days
Dm        E  Am
You won't win

Am        F            Am
With your standards so high
Am       F          Am
And your spirits so low
Am       Dm
At least remember
Dm      E
This is you on a bad day you on a pale day

C            G        C
Just do your best and oh
C     G     C
Don't worry oh
C           G        Em      D#      D
The way you hang yourself is oh so unfair

Am      F                Am

Am          F                Am
Against the worst of how you are
Am  Dm              E  Am
And again you won't win

Am        F            Am
With your standards so high
Am       F          Am
And your spirits so low
Am       Dm
At least remember
Dm      E
This is you on a drab day you in a drab dress
