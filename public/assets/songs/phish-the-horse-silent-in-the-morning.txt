Am C G

Am                    C                             G
It's time I sling the baskets off this overburdened horse
D                     C                          Am    D
Sink my toes into the ground and set a different course
D                        C
Cause if I were here and you were there
C               Am
I'd meet you in between
C                Em        C                   G
And not until my dying day confess what I have seen

G
My glance is always darting when I stroll the avenue
G
Avoiding all the obstacles that terrorize my view
C                                               G
If you are here with me I trust you to lead the way
D                           C                G
When you're not I follow you and always go astray

G
You're silent in the morning suspended in the trees
G
Lunch time comes you've found your voice it brings me to my knees
C                                               G
The volume just increases the resounding echoes grow
D                                C                G
Til once again I bask in morning stillness I love so

G
The target that I shoot for seems to move with every breath
G
I tighten all my arteries and make one last request
C                                                G
Divine creation hears me and he squashes me with fear
D                             C                        D
I think that this exact thing happened to me just last year
