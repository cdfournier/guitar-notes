F#m                  D
Take a look at these hands
F#m                  D
Take a look at these hands
F#m            D
The hand speaks
D             F#m
The hand of a government man
F#m        D
Well I'm a tumbler
F#m        D
Born under punches I'm so thin

F#m   D          F#m
All I want is to breathe I'm too thin
F#m       D            F#m
Won't you breathe with me
F#m           D                F#m
Find a little space so we move in-between
F#m               D        F#m
And keep one step ahead of yourself

F#m                         D
Don't you miss it don't you miss it
D                             F#m
Some of you people just about missed it
F#m               D           F#m
Last time to make plans
F#m        D
Well I'm a tumbler I'm a government man

F#m           D               F#m
Never seen anything like that before
F#m            D                F#m
Falling bodies tumble cross the floor but I'm a tumbler
F#m             D               F#m
When you get to where you wanna be thank you thank you
F#m             D               F#m
When you get to where you wanna be yeah don't even mention it

F#m                  D
Take a look at these hands they're passing in-between us
F#m                  D
Take a look at these hands
F#m                  D
Take a look at these hands you don't have to mention it
F#m             D
No thanks I'm a government man
