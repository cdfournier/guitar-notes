D
There's a reason for the sun-shining sky
D
And there's a reason why I'm feeling so high
D           A
Must be the season
A                               D
When that love light shines all around us

D
So let that feeling grab you deep inside
D
And send you reeling where your love can't hide
D           A
And then go stealing
A                                    D
Through the moonlit nights with your lover

D             G
Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
G            D
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
D            A
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
A        D
It's the season

D        G
Let your love fly like a bird on a wing
G            D
And let your love bind you to all living things
D            A
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
A          D
That's the reason

D
There's a reason for the warm sweet nights
D
And there's a reason for the candlelights
D           A
Must be the season
A                                D
When those love lights shine all around us

D
So let that wonder take you into space
D
And lay you under its loving embrace
D             A
Just feel the thunder
A                               D
As it warms your face you can't hold back
