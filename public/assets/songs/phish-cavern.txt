Em Em D A - Em Em D A

A    Em
Your time is near the mission's clear
     D             A
It's later than we think
Em
Before you slip into the night
Em     D                  A
You'll want something to drink

G                     D
Steal away before the dawn and
Em                 D
Bring us back good news
Em
But if you've tread in primal soup
Em     D                 A
Please wipe it from your shoes

Em Em D A - Em Em D A

Em
Just then a porthole pirate
Em           D                A
Scourged the evening with his cry
    Em
And sanctuary bugs deprived
Em  D             A
The monkey of its thigh

G                D
A dust arose and clogged my nose
Em                   D
Before I could blink twice
Em
Despite the scut that bubbled up
  D              A
I gave some last advice

    D                  A
The flesh from Satan's dogs
A             C            G
Will make the rudiments of gruel

Em
Deduct the carrots from your pay
    D                A
You worthless swampy fool

Em Em D A - Em Em D A

Em
Exploding then through fields and fen
    D               A
And swimming in the mire
Em
The septic maiden's gargoyle tooth
D                A
Demented me with fire

  G                 D
I drifted where the current chose
 Em            D
Afloat upon my back
Em
And if perchance a newt slimed by
    D              A
I'd stuff it in my sack

Em Em D A - Em Em D A

Em
Soon I felt a bubble form
    D              A
Somewhere below my skin
Em
But with handy spine of hedgehog
    D               A
I removed the force within

G            D
Suzie then removed her mask
    Em              D
And caused a mighty stir
Em
The angry mob responded
       D                 A
Taking turns at grabbing her

    D              A
The foggy cavern's musty grime
C                  G
Appeared within my palm

Em
I snatched Rick's fork to scrape it off
     D          A
With deadly icy calm

Em Em D A - Em Em D A

Em
The crowd meanwhile had taken Sue
    D               A
And used her like a rag
Em
To mop the slime from where the slug
    D                  A
Had slithered with the bag

   G              D
In summing up the moral seems
  Em         D
A little bit obscure

E          A        D         A
Give the director a serpent deflector
E          A        D         A
A mudrat detector a ribbon reflector
E            A        D          A
A cushion convector a picture of nectar
E          A         D       A
A virile dissector a hormone collector

E          A        D         A
Give the director a serpent deflector
E          A        D         A
A mudrat detector a ribbon reflector
E            A        D          A
A cushion convector a picture of nectar
E          A         D       A
A virile dissector a hormone collector

E          A        D         A
Give the director a serpent deflector
E          A        D         A
A mudrat detector a ribbon reflector
E            A        D          A
A cushion convector a picture of nectar
E          A         D       A
A virile dissector a hormone collector

E          A        D         A
Give the director a serpent deflector
E          A        D         A
A mudrat detector a ribbon reflector
E            A        D          A
A cushion convector a picture of nectar
E          A         D       A
A virile dissector a hormone collector

E            A       D            A
Whatever you do take care of your shoes
