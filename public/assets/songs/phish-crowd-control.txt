D
Listen now I'm talking I've been here for weeks
G
Waiting in this growing crowd staring at my feet

D
The world around me's turning
A
I'm just standing still
D
The time has come for changes
A                 D
Do something or I will

D
I'm a feather in a storm I'm a raindrop in the sea
G
If I don't get enough of you I'm a lighter shade of me

D
Sisters brothers all around you
A
There's a devil in the crowd
D
Meet his eye and it's the end of time
A                          D
If you're praying don't be loud

C
It's crowded in the lowland
D
But the fools stay on the hill
C
You control us now you have the reins
C                  A
Do something or we will

D
So show us why we came here before we lay on the ground
G
Give it to us loud and clear make the devil turn around

D
The world around me's turning
A
I'm just standing still
D
The time has come for changes
A                 D
Do something or I will

D
The time has come for changes
A                 D
Do something or I will
