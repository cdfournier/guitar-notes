G    Em   C         D
Joey baby don't get crazy
G       Em     C     D
Detours fences I get defensive

D             G
I know you've heard it all before
G          Em
So I don't say it anymore
Em           C
I just stand by and let you
C                 D
Fight your secret war

D            G
And though I used to wonder why
G         Em
I used to cry till I was dry
Em        C             D            Em
Still sometimes I get a strange pain inside
   C              D             G 
Oh Joey if you're hurting so am I

G    Em    C          D
Joey honey I got some money
G         Em    C      D
All is forgiven listen listen

D        G
But if I seem to be confused
G        Em
I didn't mean to be with you
Em           C
And when you said I scared you
C                          D
Well I guess you scared me too

D          G
But we got lucky once before
G           Em
And I don't want to close the door
Em            C
And if you're somewhere out there
D                 Em
Passed out on the floor
   C            D        G
Oh Joey I'm not angry anymore

G Em C D - G Em C D

D        G
And if I seem to be confused
G        Em
I didn't mean to be with you
Em           C
And when you said I scared you
C                          D
Well I guess you scared me too

D           G
But if it's love you're looking for
G          Em
Then I can give a little more
Em            C
And if you're somewhere drunk and
D                 Em
Passed out on the floor
   C            D        G
Oh Joey I'm not angry anymore
D        G    D        G
Angry anymore angry anymore
