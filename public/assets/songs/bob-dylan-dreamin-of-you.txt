D A

A                 D    A          D
The light in this place is really bad
A                 D           A     D
Like being at the bottom of a stream
A           D   A   D
 Any minute now
    A                 D         A    D
I'm expecting to wake up from a dream

G    D   E
Means so much
G    D            E
      The softest touch

E      A             D
By the grave of some child
D           A       D
Who neither wept or smiled
  A           D            A   D
I pondered my faith in the rain

A                     D   A            D
I've been dreaming of you that's all I do
D        A       D  A    D
And it's driving me insane

A         D              A  D
Somewhere dawn is breaking
A        D                   A   D
Light is streaking cross the floor
A      D               A  D
Church bells are ringing
A                    D       A  D
I wonder who they're ringing for

G      D         E
Travel under any star
G             D            E
You'll see me wherever you are

A           D       A            D
The shadowy past is awake and so vast
A                   D         A    D
I'm sleeping in the palace of pain

A                     D   A            D
I've been dreaming of you that's all I do
D        A       D  A    D
But it's driving me insane

A             D     A           D
Maybe they'll get me maybe they won't
A               D        A      D
But whatever it won't be tonight
A           D           A          D
I wish your hand was in mine right now
A                     D       A     D
We could go where the moon is white

G                     D           E
For years they had me locked in a cage
G                  D        E
Then they threw me onto the stage

A                     D
Some things just last longer
D        A                 D
Than you thought they would
A        D          A       D
And they never ever explain

A                     D   A            D
I've been dreaming of you that's all I do
D        A       D  A    D
And it's driving me insane

A D A D - A D A D - A D A D - A D A D

A                   D
Well I eat when I'm hungry
A                   D
Drink when I'm dry
A       D           A      D
Live my life on the square
A           D           A      D
Even if the flesh falls off my face
A               D              A     D
It won't matter long as you're there

G           D        E
Feel like a ghost in love
G              D       E
Underneath the heavens above

A            D    A               D
Feel further away than I ever did before
A    D                  A   D
Feel further than I can take

A           D   A            D
Dreaming of you that's all I do
D        A       D  A    D
But it's driving me insane

A D A D - A D A D - A D A D - A D A D

A                 D         A          D
Everything in the way is so shiny today
A           D       A    D
A queer and unusual fall
A          D
Spirals of golden haze
A                   D
Here and there in a blaze
A             D            A     D
Like beams of light in the storm

G              D                  E
Maybe you were here and maybe you weren't
G         D                        E
Maybe you touched somebody and got burnt

A          D       A             D
The silent sun has got me on the run
A         D          A    D
Burning a hole in my brain

A                     D   A            D
I've been dreaming of you that's all I do
D        A       D  A    D
But it's driving me insane
