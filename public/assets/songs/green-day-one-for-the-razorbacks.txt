Juliet's trying
   C                 F                   C
To find out what she wants but she don't know
G                      C
Experience has got her down
C                 G
Well look in this direction
  C             F                    C
I know it's not perfection it's just me
C       G                  C
I wanna bring you up again now

C         G                  F     C
Cause I'm losing what's left of my dignity
C       G                 F               C
A small price I'll pay to see that you're happy
C      G       F                        C
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
C    G               F                C
Open up your worried world and let me in

Juliet's crying
G    C         F                  C
Well now she's realizing love can be
C           G        C
Filled with pain and distrust
C           G
I know I am crazy
G     C   F               C
And a bit lazy but I will try
C        G            C
To bring you up again somehow

C         G                  F     C
Cause I'm losing what's left of my dignity
C       G                 F               C
A small price I'll pay to see that you're happy
C      G       F                        C
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
C    G               F                C
Open up your worried world and let me in
