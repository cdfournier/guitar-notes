Am                     F
Nothing could bring me closer
G                      Am
Nothing could bring me near

Where is the road I follow
G        Am
To leave leave

Am                        F
It's under under under my feet
G                        Am
The sea spread out there before me
Am                     F
Where do I go when the land touches the sea
G                    Am

I know where I marked the signs

Am                       F
I suffer the dreams of a world gone mad
G                         Am
I like it like that and I know it
Am             F
I know it well ugly and sweet
G                        Am
I temper madness with an even extreme

Am
That's what keeps me
F
That's what keeps me
G                    Am
That's what keeps me down
Am
I say that I'm a bantam lightweight
F
I say that I'm a phantom airplane
G                   Am
That never left the ground

C
That's what keeps me

Leave it all behind

Am      F
Lift me lift me

G         Am
Heartache calling me

G                Am
I lost myself in pain
Am               F
I lost myself in gravity

Memory leave leave

I'll walk into the sea
Am                F
Shoot myself in a different place
