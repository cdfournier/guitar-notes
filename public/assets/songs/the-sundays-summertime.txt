Some people wind up
E        A             E
With the one that they adore
E    A            E
In a heart-shaped hotel room
E    A               E
It's what a heart is for
E                    A
The bubble floats so madly
A                E
Will it stay sky-high
E        A              E
Hello partner kiss your name bye-bye
   D
Oh sometimes

Romantic Piscean seeks angel in disguise
Chinese-speaking girlfriend big brown eyes
Liverpudlian lady sophisticated male
Hello partner tell me love can't fail


And it's you and me in the summertime
We'll be hand-in-hand down in the park
With a squeeze and a sigh
And that twinkle in your eye
And all the sunshine banishes the dark


Some people wind up
With the one that they abhor
In a distant hell-hole room
This third World War
But all I see is films where a colorless despair
Meant angry young men with immaculate hair
Ooh sometimes


Get up a voice inside says
There's no time for looking down
Only a Pound a word
And you're talking to the town
And how do you coin the phrase though
That will set your soul apart
Just to touch a lonely heart


And it's you and me in the summertime
We'll be hand-in-hand down in the park
With a squeeze and a sigh
And the twinkle in your eye
And all the sunshine banishes the dark


And it's you I need in the summertime
As I turn my white skin red
Two peas from the same pod yes we are
Or have I read too much fiction
Is this how it happens


How does it happen
How does it happen
How does it happen
Is this how it happens
