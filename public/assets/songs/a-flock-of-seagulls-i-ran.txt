Am
I walked along the avenue
Am                                   G
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you
G
Meet a girl like you
Am
With auburn hair and tawny eyes
Am                                 G
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
G
Hypnotize me through

G     F                G
And I ran I ran so far away
G      F                       G
I just ran I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

Am
A cloud appears above your head
Am                                    G
A beam of light comes shining down on you
G
Shining down on you
Am
The cloud is moving nearer still
Am                       G
Aurora Borealis comes in view
G
Aurora comes in view

G     F                G
And I ran I ran so far away
G      F                       G
I just ran I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

Am
Reached out a hand to touch your face
Am                                 G
You're slowly disappearing from my view
G
Appearing from my view
Am
Reached out a hand to try again
Am                                   G
I'm floating in a beam of light with you
G
A beam of light with you

G     F                G
And I ran I ran so far away
G      F                       G
I just ran I ran all night and day
G     F                G
And I ran I ran so far away
G      F                  G
I just ran I couldn't get away
