A     D              A
But I want him by my side
A           G             A
Though he's wild and he's bad
    D                    G
And sometimes just plain mad

I need him to keep me satisfied

Though he might not give me
A   D             G
The life that you wanted

Soul like a Lucifer
A         D                    G
Black and cold like a piece of lead
D         A              D
Misguided angel love you til I'm dead

D                                 A
I said Brother you speak to me of passion
A        G        A                  D
You said never to settle for nothing less
D         G             A
Well it's in the way he walks
A    D             G
It's in the way he talks
G   D         A             D
His smile his anger and his kisses

D                       A

A    D                 A
He's all I ever wanted in a man
A   G                A
I'm tired of sitting around
A   D        G
The TV every night
D          A         D

Black and cold like a piece of lead

Misguided angel love you til I'm dead

D                            A
He says Baby don't listen to what they say
A     G                 A           D
There comes a time when you have to break away
D       G              A
He says Baby there are things
A      D                G
We all cling to all our life
G    D                A        D
