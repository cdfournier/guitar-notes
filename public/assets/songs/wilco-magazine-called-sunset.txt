          D               G
There's a magazine called Sunset
      Bm                E
And a tape machine that won't let
   G                D                      A7
Me ever forget this impossible longing for you

      D                      G
Let's take a map across your pillow
    Bm                 E
And breathe the sky in through your window
     G                      D                     A7
I'll stay in the riddle and watch your books cave in

    D                   G
Oh maybe you're my inspiration
     Bm                  E
Just lead me to some new sensation
     G             D                       A7
I'll make a little guide they can call our own

      D                         G
Cause there's a magazine called Sunset
      Bm                E
And a tape machine that won't ever let
   G                D                      A7
Me forget this impossible longing I have for you

D G Bm E G D A7

   D            G
Oh I'm a future fallout standing
Bm             E
In the present erase our phantom

          D       G
There's a magazine
          Bm      E
There's a magazine
             G       D   A7
Oh there's a magazine oh yeah

D G Bm E G D A7

   D            G
Oh I'm a future fallout standing
Bm             E
In the present erase our phantom

E            D      G       Bm         E
Oh there's a magazine and a tape machine
E         G        D    A7
Oh that's everything

A7           D      G       Bm         E
Oh there's a magazine and a tape machine
E         G        D    A7
Oh that's everything oh yeah
