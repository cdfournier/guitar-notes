A                F#
You only got one finger left
F#       D               A
And it's pointing at the door
A                     F#
And you're taking for granted
F#       D                  A
What the Lord's laid on the floor
A                     F#
So I'm picking up the pieces
F#      D                   A
And I'm putting them up for sale
A                              F#
Throw your meal ticket out the window
F#       D            A
Put your skeletons in jail

E                                  A
Cause Lord only knows it's getting late
E                                     A
Your senses are gone so don't you hesitate
D                  F#
To give yourself a call
F#       A              F#
Let your bottom dollars fall
F                     E              A
Throwing your two bit cares down the drain

A                F#
Invite me to the seven seas
D                 A
Like some seasick man
A            F#
You'll do whatever you please
F#  D                  A
And I'll do whatever I can
A       F#
Titanic fare thee well
F# D                A
My eyes are turning pink
A                      F#
Don't call us when the new age
F#   D             A
Gets old enough to drink

E                                  A
Cause Lord only knows it's getting late
E                                     A
Your senses are gone so don't you hesitate
D                 F#
To move on up the hill
F#      A            F#
There's nothing dead left to kill
F                     E              A
Throwing your two bit cares down the drain

Going back to Houston
A              D
To get me some pants
