Last night I said to her
D                              Am
I didn't want to live inside a lie
Am
If she wants him more than she wants me
Am       D
Let this be

C           D       G
She'll come back to me
C           D       G
She'll come back to me
C           D
She'll come back

G
All day I wait and wait
D
To hear her footsteps
D     Am
On my walkway she never came
Am             D
She never even called

C           D        G
She'll come back to me
C           D       G
She'll come back to me
C           D
She'll come back

C         G
Somehow I know
C  D     G
It won't last
C         G
Somehow I know
C  D     G    C   D
It won't last too long
