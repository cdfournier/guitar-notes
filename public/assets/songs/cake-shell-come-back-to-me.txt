G                       D
Last night I said to her
D                              Am
I didn't want to live inside a lie
Am
If she wants him more than she wants me
Am       D
Let this be

C           D       G
She'll come back to me
C           D       G
She'll come back to me
C           D       G
She'll come back

G                      D
All day I wait and wait
D                           Am
To hear her footsteps on my walkway
Am
She never came
Am             D
She never even called

C           D       G
She'll come back to me
C           D       G
She'll come back to me
C           D
She'll come back

C         G
Somehow I know
C  D     G
It won't last
C         G
Somehow I know
C  D     G    C   D
It won't last too long
