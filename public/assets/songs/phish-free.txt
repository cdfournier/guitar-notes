D                   C
I'm floating in the blimp a lot
D                    C
I feel the feeling I forgot
C        G          F      D
Swimming weightless in the womb
D        G      F         D
Bouncing gently round the room
D    G      F       D
In a minute I'll be free
D            G         F      D
And we'll be splashing in the sea

D              C
I feel no curiosity
D              C
I see the path ahead of me
D    G      F       D
In a minute I'll be free
D            G         F      D
And we'll be splashing in the sea
D  G      F    D
We hear a tiny cry
D      G         F       D
As the ship goes sliding by
