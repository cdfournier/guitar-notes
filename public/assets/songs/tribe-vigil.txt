Am          G               F           C
Tossing and turning as your sheets wrap around you
         Am           G                 F          C
And your breathing is peaceful but your sleep is unsettling
Am         G             F              C
Slowly and steadily your memories start spinning round
        Am          G               F       C
And you try hard to follow you will want to remember

Am G F C

    Am               G              F      C
The breeze moves the curtains as it passes across your arms
        Am         G              F            C
And you stir as it passes but you can't really feel it now
Am           G             F          C
Something is different the colors are shimmering
         Am             G                F             C
And your breathing gets quicker and your arms start to stiffen

Am                   G                   F                C
You know that you're sleeping and you're sure that you're sleeping
      Am      G                     F       C
Under certain conditions this could be terrifying
Am           G           F          C
Movement and quality are somehow in harmony
        Am            G                 F       C
And you might like to linger but you're feeling   kinetic

Am G F C
