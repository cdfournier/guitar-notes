        G                     C                        D
You can write your tunes with rhythm and blues as your alibi
        G                  C                        D
You can sell your soul and lay the blame all on the passers-by
G                C         D
You shake your body on the TV screen
D                    C            G
It seems to me you'd try anything twice

G                    C                   D
And swing it out and use it as your aphrodisiac
        G
You can give it to me to me
C                      D
Plain to see that I'll give it you back
G               C                 D
You let it flow let it go there's nothing to it
D          C            G     C            Em    D
Anyone can try anything twice try anything twice

G             C                 F            Em
Chasing after stories that have already been told
G                  C                F     Em
Could not look old Son House in the eyes
G           C            F       Em
Unaware you carry such a fragile load
G                      C
But I've got yours and you've got mine
C      F
It's a rhythm and blues alibi

Cause you are walking a fine fine line la
G              C            D
You shake your booty on the TV screen
D                 C            G
