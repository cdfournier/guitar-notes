Well I don't know why I came here tonight
D
I've got the feeling that something ain't right
D      G
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
G       D
And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs

G      D
Here I am stuck in the middle with you

D
Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you
D
And I'm wondering what it is I should do
D       G
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face

Losing control yeah I'm all over the place

Well you started off with nothing
G                              D

Slap you on the back and say
D
Please
Am
Please

D
Trying to make some sense of it all
D
But I can see it makes no sense at all

Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor
G       D
Cause I don't think that I can take anymore
