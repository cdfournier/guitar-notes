Em        Am       D
I feel so extraordinary
Bm
Something's got a hold on me
Em                 Am     D
I get this feeling I'm in motion
Bm
A sudden sense of liberty

Em                 D
I don't care cause I'm not there
D   C                   Bm
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
D                    C
Again and again I've taken too much
Bm
Of the things that cost you too much

Em                       G               D
I used to think that the day would never come

I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
Em                    G                   D

D                  A                Em
To the childhood I lost replaced by fear

That my life would depend on the morning sun

Em           C    D
When I was a very small boy
Bm
Very small boys talked to me
Em                   C    D
Now that we've grown up together
Bm
They're afraid of what they see

Em                    D
That's the price that we all pay
D       C                Bm
And the value of destiny comes to nothing
D                C
I can't tell you where we're going
  Bm
I guess there's just no way of knowing

Em                       G               D

Em                    D
The chances are we've gone too far
D   C                    Bm
You took my time and you took my money
D                 C
Now I fear you've left me standing
Bm
In a world that's so demanding
