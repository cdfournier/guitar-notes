Just about a year ago
  C              G
I set out on the road
G                   Em
Seeking my fame and fortune
C                    D
Looking for a pot of gold
G                  Em
Things got bad and things got worse
  C                       G
I guess you will know the tune
G       D             C    G
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again

G
Rode in on the Greyhound
        C                G
I'll be walking out if I go
G                  Em
I was just passing through
        C               D
Must be seven months or more
G                   Em
Ran out of time and money
C                       G
Looks like they took my friends
G           D             C    G
Oh Lord I'm stuck in Lodi again

The man from the magazine
C                G
Said I was on my way
G                Em
Somewhere I lost connections
C                     D
I ran out of songs to play
G                  Em
I came into town a one night stand
C                        G
Looks like my plans fell through
G       D             C    G
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again

If I only had a dollar
    D               A
For every song I've sung
A               F#m
Every time I've had to play
      D                E
While people sat there drunk
    A                  F#m
You know I'd catch the next train
D               A
Back to where I live
A           E             D    A
Oh Lord I'm stuck in Lodi again
A           E             D    A
Oh Lord I'm stuck in Lodi again
