G                  D       G
I'd say love was a magical thing
G                  D            G
I'd say love would keep us from pain
      Am               G
Had I been there had I been there
G                   D         G
I would promise you all of my life
G                     D          G
But to lose you would cut like a knife
     Am              G
So I don't dare no I don't dare

G                              D            G
Cause I've never come close in all of these years
G                       D       G
You are the only one to stop my tears
    Am                   G
And I'm so scared I'm so scared

G D G D G Am G

G                          D     G
Take me back in time maybe I can forget
G                              D           G
Turn a different corner and we never would have met
Am        G
Would you care
G                         D          G
I don't understand it for you it's a breeze
G                       D                G
Little by little you've brought me to my knees
Am
Don't you care

G                           D            G
No I've never come close in all of these years
G                       D       G
You are the only one to stop my tears
Am                    G
I'm so scared of this love
G                                D             G
And if all that there is is this fear of being used
G                         D          G
I should go back to being lonely and confused
Am   G       D       G
If I could I would I swear
