A
We crossed the line who pushed who over
A
It doesn't matter to you it matters to me
A
We're cut adrift but still floating
A                                   E       A
I'm only hanging on to watch you go down my love

A
I disappeared in you
A
You disappeared from me
A
I gave you everything you ever wanted
A
It wasn't what you wanted
A
The men who love you you hate the most
A
They pass right through you like a ghost
A                                           E
They look for you but your spirit is in the air
E           A
Baby you're nowhere

A                  D          E      A
Oh love you say in love there are no rules
A D E A         E               A
Oh    love sweetheart you're so cruel

A
Desperation is a tender trap
A
It gets you every time
A
You put your lips to her lips
A
To stop the lie
A
Her skin is pale like God's only dove
A
Screams like an angel for your love
A                                 E
Then she makes you watch her from above
E                       A
And you need her like a drug

A                  D          E      A
Oh love you say in love there are no rules
A D E A         E               A
Oh    love sweetheart you're so cruel

F#m                      A
She wears my love like a see-through dress
A                          E
Her lips say one thing her movements something else
E  C#m
Oh love like a screaming flower
C#m                 A
Love dying every hour

A
Ah you don't know if it's fear or desire
A
Danger the drug that takes you higher
A
Head of heaven fingers in the mire
A
Her heart is racing you can't keep up
A
The night is bleeding like a cut
A                                          E        A
Between the horses of love and lust we are trampled underfoot

A                    D       E    A
Oh love to stay with you I'd be a fool
A D E A         E               A
Oh    love sweetheart you're so cruel
