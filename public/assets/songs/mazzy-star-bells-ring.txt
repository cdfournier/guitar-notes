G          C
Bells ring into the night
G                           C
Sounds like a mistress on a rainy night
G                    C
Hold your throat and arms together
G                      C
And see the light that goes away

G                   C
Leave my heart down by the water
G                    C
Leave a space inside my soul
G                        C
It isn't true about your father
G                 C
Just hold me down by the water

They say you look like a believer

Look up to see your weakness in the sky
G                        C
Nobody's out to buy your story
G                         C
Nobody wants to know your reason why

G                   C
Hold your hands out towards the water
G                      C
In front of me to know I'm with you
G                          C
Don't put it all into your hero
G              C
Look on if you believe
G              C
Look on if you believe
G              C
Look on if you believe

G                          C
Don't want to say that I'm through with it
G                        C
Just want to be right by your side
G C G                  C
     Right by your side
