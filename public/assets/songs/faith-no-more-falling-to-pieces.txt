A D E G

A
Back and forth I sway with the wind
Resolution slips away again
Right through my fingers back into my heart
Where it's out of reach and it's in the dark

D
Sometimes I think I'm blind
Or I may be just paralyzed

A
Because the plot thickens every day
And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumbling away
But I know there's a picture beneath

E     D    E         D
Indecision clouds my vision
D      E
No one listens

E                     A  D  E
Because I'm somewhere in between
E              A D E
My love and my agony
E                     A  D  E
You see I'm somewhere in between
E                     G
My life is falling to pieces
G                      A
Somebody put me together

A
Laying face down on the ground
My fingers in my ears to block the sound
My eyes shutting tight to avoid the sight
Anticipating the end losing the will to fight

D
Droplets of yes and no in an ocean of maybe
From the bottom it looks like a steep incline

A
From the top another downhill slope of mine
But I know the equilibrium's there

E     D    E         D
Indecision clouds my vision
D      E
No one listens

E                     A  D  E
Because I'm somewhere in between
E              A D E
My love and my agony
E                     A  D  E
You see I'm somewhere in between
