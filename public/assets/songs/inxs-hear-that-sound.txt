G       C
So your time has come
C
Children watch the fools
C         A#          F
Don't let anyone tell you
F             C
What you must do

C
Do you like what you see
C
Or does it make you cry
C        A#        F
Use your imagination
F           C
And start a fire

G D#        A#         F
     Making changes go round
G D# A#        F
     Hear that sound

F      C
And my selfish ways
C
Disappeared one day
C        A#        F
With the realization
F        C
Of a new way

C
Images of the free
C
Coming into view
C          A#      F
Our hearts full of promises
F             C
Of all we can do
