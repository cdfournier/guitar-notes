I walked forty-seven miles of barbed wire
I got a cobra snake for a necktie
A brand new house on the road side
And it's a-made out of rattlesnake hide
Got a band new chimney baby I put on top
And it's a-made out of human skull
Come on take a little walk with me baby
And tell me who do you love
Who do you love

Now around the town I use a rattlesnake whip
Take it easy baby don't you give me no lip
Who do you love
Who do you love

I've got a tombstone hand and a graveyard mind
I'm just twenty-two and I don't mind dying
Who do you love
Yeah who do you love
Ah who do you love

Now Arlene took a-me by my hand
She said Lonesome George you don't understand
Who do you love
The night were dark and the sky were blue
Down the alleyway a ice wagon flew
Hit a bump and somebody screamed
You should've heard what I'd seen
Who do you love
Who do you love
Yeah who do you love
Ah who do you love

Yeah I've got a tombstone hand a graveyard mine
Just twenty-two baby I don't mind dying
Snake skin shoes and baby put them on your feet
Got the good time music with the Bo Diddley beat
Yeah who do you love
Hoo! Who do you love

I walked forty-seven miles of barbed wire
I got a cobra snake for a necktie
A brand new house on the road side
And it's made out of rattlesnake hide
Got a band new chimney my momma I put on top
And it's made out of human skull
Come on take a little walk with me child
Tell me who do you love
Yeah who do you love
Hoo who do you love

Who do you love
