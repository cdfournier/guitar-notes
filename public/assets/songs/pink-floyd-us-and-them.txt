D      E      F
Us and them
F                        G
And after all we're only ordinary men

D

D      E      F
Me and you
F                            G
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do

Forward he cried from the rear
Bm            A    G    C
And the front rank died
    Bm
The general sat and the lines on the map
A   G                  C
    Moved from side to side

D         E      F
Black and blue
F                                G
And who knows which is which and who is who
D         E      F
Up and    down
F                        G
And in the end it's only round and round and round

D A 

Bm
Haven't you heard it's a battle of words
A   G             C
The poster bearer cried
Bm
Listen son said the man with the gun
A       G              C
There's room for you inside

D        E      F
Down and out
F                                G
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about
D        E      F
With without
F                             G
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about

D A

Bm
Out of the way it's a busy day
A    G                C
I've got things on my mind
    Bm
For want of the price of tea and a slice
    G       C
The old man died
