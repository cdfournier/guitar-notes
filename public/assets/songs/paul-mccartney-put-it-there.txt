G
Give me your hand
D
I'd like to shake it
G                           D
I want to show you I'm your friend
G
You'll understand
D
If I can make it clear
G                            D
It's all that matters in the end

D      Bm   A               G
Put it there if it weighs a ton
G             D      A           G
That's what a father said to his younger son
G       Bm  A               G
I don't care if it weighs a ton
G          D             A           G
As long as you and I are here put it there
G       D             A           D
Long as you and I are here put it there

G
If there's a fight
D
I'd like to fix it
G                          D
I hate to see things go so wrong
G
The darkest night
D
And all it's mixed emotions
G                       D
Is getting lighter sing along

D      Bm   A               G
Put it there if it weighs a ton
G             D      A           G
That's what a father said to his younger son
G       Bm  A               G
I don't care if it weighs a ton
G          D             A           G
As long as you and I are here put it there
G       D             A           D
Long as you and I are here put it there
