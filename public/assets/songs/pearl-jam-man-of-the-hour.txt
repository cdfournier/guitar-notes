C                 G
Tidal waves don't beg forgiveness
C                     G
Crashed then on their way
C         G                 Am
Father he enjoyed collisions
Am            G
Others walked away
  Am                 G
A snowflake falls in May

G       Dm             G
And the doors are open now
G      Am        D
As the bells are ringing out
D         F
Cause the man of the hour
F  G
Is taking his final bow
G           C
Goodbye for now

C                 G
Nature as its own religion
C               G
Gospel from the land
C               G
Father ruled by long division
Am             G
Young men they pretend
Am      G
Old men comprehend

G       Dm            G
And the sky breaks at dawn
G        Am              D
Shedding light upon this town
D
They'll all come around
D         F
Cause the man of the hour
F  G
Is taking his final bow
G           C
Goodbye for now

C       E
And the road
E   F
The old man paved
F          C               D
The broken seams along the way
D          F                   E
The rusted signs left just for me
E      Am         C            D
He was guiding me love his own way
D       F
Now the man of the hour
F  G
Is taking his final bow
G      F
As the curtain comes down
F           G
I feel that this is just
G           C
Goodbye for now
