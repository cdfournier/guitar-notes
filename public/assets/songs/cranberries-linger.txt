If you if you could return
D            A
Don't let it burn don't let it fade
A                   C
I'm sure I might be rude
C
But it's just your attitude
C               G
It's tearing me apart
G
It's ruining everything

G     D
And I swore I swore I would be true
D                A
And honey so did you
A                           C
So why were you holding her hand
C
Is that the way we stand
C                      G
Were you lying all the time
G
Was it just a game to you

G             D
But I'm in so deep
D                   A
You know I'm such a fool for you
A                                 C
You've got me wrapped around your finger
C                     G
Do you have to let it linger
G
Do you have to do you have to
G                     D
Do you have to let it linger

D    A
Oh I thought the world of you
A         C
I thought nothing could go wrong
C         G
But I was wrong I was wrong
   D
If you if you could get by
D             A
Trying not to lie
A                        C
Things wouldn't be so confused
C
And I wouldn't feel so used
C                     G
But you always really knew
G
I just want to be with you

G             D
And I'm in so deep
D                   A
You know I'm such a fool for you
A                                 C
You've got me wrapped around your finger
C                     G
Do you have to let it linger
G
Do you have to do you have to
G                     D
Do you have to let it linger

G             D
And I'm in so deep
D                   A
You know I'm such a fool for you
A                                 C
You've got me wrapped around your finger
C                     G
Do you have to let it linger
G
Do you have to do you have to

Do you have to let it linger

D                   A
You know I'm such a fool for you
A                                 C
You've got me wrapped around your finger
C                     G
