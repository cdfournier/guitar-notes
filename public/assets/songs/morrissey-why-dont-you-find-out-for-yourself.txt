G                   D
The sanest days are mad
D                          Am
Why don't you find out for yourself
Am                  C
Then you'll see the price very closely

Bm       Em  
Some men here
C           G
They have a special interest
Bm      Em
In your career
Em           C           D
They want to help you to grow
D   G                    D
And then siphon all your dough
D                          Am
Why don't you find out for yourself
Am                  C
Then you'll see the glass
C             G
Hidden in the grass
G                       D
You'll never believe me so
D                          Am
Why don't you find out for yourself
Am              C
Sick down to my heart
C
That's just the way it goes

Bm       Em
Some men here
C             G
They know the full extent of
Bm   Em
Your distress
Em   C         D
They kneel and pray
D        G
And they say
G           D
Long may it last
D                          Am
Why don't you find out for yourself
Am                  C
Then you'll see the glass
C             G
Hidden in the grass
G                   D
Bad scenes come and go
D                  Am
For which you must allow
Am              C
Sick down to my heart
C
That's just the way it goes

G                D
Don't rake up my mistakes
D                        Am
I know exactly what they are
Am              C
And what do you do
C             G
Well you just sit there
G                        D
I've been stabbed in the back
D            Am
So many many times
Am               C
I don't have any skin
C
But that's just the way it goes
